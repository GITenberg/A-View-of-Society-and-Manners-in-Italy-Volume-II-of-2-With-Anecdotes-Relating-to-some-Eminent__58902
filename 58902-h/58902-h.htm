the oblivious vortex of time, leaving
scarcely a wreck behind. The durable
monuments raised to fame by the inspiring
genius of <i>Pitt</i>, and the invincible
spirit of <i>Frederick</i>, will command the admiration
of future ages, outlive the
power of the empires which <i>they</i> aggrandized,
and forbid the period in which <i>they</i>
flourished, from ever passing away like the
baseless fabric of a vision. The busts and
statues of those memorable men will be
viewed, by succeeding generations, with the
same regard and attention which we now
bestow on those of Cicero and Cæsar. We
expect to find something peculiarly noble
and expressive in features which were
animated, and which, we imagine, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
have been in some degree modelled, by the
sentiments of those to whom they belonged.
It is not rank, it is character
alone which interests posterity. We know
that men may be seated on thrones, who
would have been placed more suitably to
their talents on the working-table of a
taylor; we therefore give little attention
to the busts or coins of the vulgar emperors.
In the countenance of Claudius, we
expect nothing more noble than the phlegmatic
tranquillity of an acquiescing
cuckold; in Caligula or Nero, the unrelenting
frown of a negro-driver, or the
insolent air of any unprincipled ruffian
in power. Even in the high-praised Augustus
we look for nothing essentially great,
nothing superior to what we see in those
minions of fortune, who are exalted, by a
concurrence of incidents, to a situation in
life to which their talents would never
have raised them, and which their characters
never deserved. In the face of Julius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
we expect to find the traces of deep reflection,
magnanimity, and the anxiety
natural to the man who had overturned
the liberties of his native country, and
who must have secretly dreaded the resentment
of a spirited people; and in the
face of Marcus Brutus we look for independence,
conscious integrity, and a mind
capable of the highest effort of virtue.</p>

<p>It is natural to regret, that, of the
number of antique statues which have
come to us tolerably entire, so great a proportion
are representations of gods and
goddesses. Had they been intended for
real persons, we might have had a perfect
knowledge of the face and figure of the
greatest part of the most distinguished
citizens of ancient Greece and Rome.
A man of unrelaxing wisdom would
smile with contempt, and ask, if our
having perfect representations of all the
heroes, poets, and philosophers recorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
in history, would make us either wiser or
more learned? to which I answer, That
there are a great many things, which
neither can add to my small stock of
learning nor wisdom, and yet give me
more pleasure and satisfaction than those
which do; and, unfortunately for mankind,
the greatest part of them resemble me in
this particular.</p>

<p>But though I would with pleasure
have given up a great number of the
Jupiters and Apollos and Venuses, whose
statues we have, in exchange for an equal,
or even a smaller, number of mere mortals
whom I could name; I by no means
consider the statues of those deities as
uninteresting. Though they are imaginary
beings, yet each of them has a distinct
character of his own of classical authority,
which has long been impressed on our
memories; and we assume the right of
deciding on the artist’s skill, and applauding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
or blaming, as he has succeeded or
failed in expressing the established character
of the god intended. From the
ancient artists having exercised their
genius in forming the images of an order
of beings superior to mankind, another
and a greater advantage is supposed to
have followed; it prompted the artists to
attempt the uniting in one form, the
various beauties and excellencies which
nature had dispersed in many. This was
not so easy a task as may by some be
imagined; for that which has a fine effect
in one particular face or person, may
appear a deformity when combined with
a different complexion, different features,
or a different shape. It therefore required
great judgment and taste to collect those
various graces, and combine them with
elegance and truth; and repeated efforts
of this kind are imagined to have inspired
some of the ancient sculptors with sublimer
ideas of beauty than nature herself ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
exhibited, as appears in some of their
works which have reached our own
times.</p>

<p>Though the works of no modern
artist can stand a comparison with the
great master-pieces now alluded to, yet
nothing can be more absurd than the idea
which some people entertain, that all
antique statues are of more excellent workmanship
than the modern. We see, every
day, numberless specimens of every species
of sculpture, from the largest statues and
bassos-relievos, to the smallest cameos and
intaglios, that are undoubtedly antique, and
yet far inferior, not only to the works of
the best artists of Leo the Tenth’s time, but
also to those of many artists now alive in
various parts of Europe. The passion for
sculpture, which the Romans caught from
the Greeks, became almost universal. Statues
were not only the chief ornaments of
their temples and palaces, but also of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
houses of the middle, and even the lowest,
order of citizens. They were prompted to
adorn them with the figures of a few favourite
deities, by religion, as well as
vanity: no man, but an atheist or a beggar,
could be without them. This being the
case, we may easily conceive what graceless
divinities many of them must have been;
for in this, no doubt, as in every other
manufactory, there must occasionally have
been bungling workmen employed, even
in the most flourishing æra of the arts,
and goods finished in a very careless and
hurried manner, to answer the constant
demand, and suit the dimensions of every
purse. We must have a very high idea
of the number of statues of one kind or
other, which were in old Rome, when we
consider, how many are still to be seen;
how many have at different periods been
carried away, by the curious, to every
country in Europe; how many were mutilated
and destroyed by the gothic brutality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of Barbarians, and the ill-directed
zeal of the early Christians, who thought
it a duty to exterminate every image,
without distinction of age or sex, and
without considering whether they were of
God or man. This obliged the wretched
heathens to hide the statues of their gods
and of their ancestors in the bowels of the
earth, where unquestionably great numbers
of them still remain. Had they not been
thus barbarously hewed to pieces, and buried,
I had almost said, alive, we might
have had several equal to the great master-pieces
in the Vatican; for it is natural to
imagine, that the rage of the zealots
would be chiefly directed against those
statues which were in the highest estimation
with the heathens; and we must likewise
imagine, that these would be the
pieces which they, on their part, would
endeavour, by every possible means, to preserve
from their power, and bury in the
earth. Of those which have been dug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
up, I shall mention only a very few, beginning
with the Farnesian Hercules,
which has been long admired as an exquisite
model of masculine strength; yet,
admirable as it is, it does not please all the
world. I am told that the women in particular
find something unsatisfactory, and
even odious, in this figure; which, however
majestic, is deficient in the charms
most agreeable to them, and which might
have been expected in the son of Jupiter
and the beauteous Alcmena. A lady whom
I accompanied to the Farnese palace, turned
away from it in disgust. I could not
imagine what had shocked her. She told
me, <i>after recollection</i>, that she could not
bear the stern severity of his countenance,
his large brawny limbs, and the club with
which he was armed; which gave him
more the appearance of one of those
giants that, according to the old romances,
carried away virgins and shut them
up in gloomy castles, than the gallant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Hercules, the lover of Omphale. Finally,
the lady declared, she was convinced this
statue could not be a just representation of
Hercules; for it was not in the nature of
things, that a man so formed could ever
have been a reliever of distressed damsels.</p>

<p>Without such powerful support as that
of the fair sex, I should not have exposed
myself to the resentment of connoisseurs,
by any expression which they might construe
an attack upon this favourite statue;
but, with their support, I will venture to
assert, that the Farnese Hercules is faulty
both in his form and attitude: the former
is too unwieldy for active exertion, and
the latter exhibits vigour <i>exhausted</i>. A
resting attitude is surely not the most
proper in which the all-conquering god
of strength could be represented. Rest implies
fatigue, and fatigue strength exhausted.
A reposing Hercules is almost a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
contradiction. Invincible activity, and inexhaustible
strength, are his characteristics.
The ancient artist has erred, not only
in giving him an attitude which supposes
his strength wants recruiting, but in the
nature of the strength itself, the character
of which should not be passive, but
active.</p>

<p>Near to Hercules, under the arcades of
the same Palazzo Farnese, is a most beautiful
statue of Flora. The great advantage
which ancient artists had in attending the
exercises of the gymnasia, has been repeatedly
urged as the reason of their superiority
over the moderns in sculpture.
We are told, that besides the usual exercises
of the gymnasia, all those who proposed
to contend at the Olympic games, were
obliged, by the regulations, to prepare themselves,
by exercising publicly for a year
at Elis; and the statuaries and painters
constantly attended on the Arena, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
they had opportunities of beholding
the finest shaped, the most graceful,
and most vigorous of the Grecian youth
employed in those manly sports, in which
the power of every muscle was exerted,
and all their various actions called forth,
and where the human form appeared in an
infinite variety of different attitudes. By
a constant attendance at such a school, independent
of any other circumstance, the
artists are supposed to have acquired a more
animated, true, and graceful style, than
possibly can be caught from viewing the
tame, mercenary models, which are exhibited
in our academies. On the other
hand, I have heard it asserted, that the
artist, who formed the Farnesian Flora,
could not have improved his work, or derived
any of its excellencies, from the circumstances
above enumerated; because the
figure is in a standing posture, and clothed.
In the light, easy flow of the drapery, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
in the contour of the body being as distinctly
pronounced through it, as if the figure
were naked, the chief merit of this statue
is thought to consist. But this reasoning
does not seem just; for the daily opportunities
the ancient artists had of seeing
naked figures, in every variety of action
and attitude, must have given them advantages
over the moderns, in forming even
drapery figures. At Sparta, the women,
upon particular occasions, danced naked.
In their own families; they were seen every
day clothed in light draperies; and so secondary
was every consideration, even that
of decency, to art, that the prettiest virgins
of Agrigentum, it is recorded, were
called upon by the legislature, without distinction,
to shew themselves naked to a
painter, to enable him to paint a Venus.
Whilst the moderns, therefore, must acknowledge
their inferiority to the ancients
in the art of sculpture, they may be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
merit, on account of the cause, to which it
seems, in some measure at least, to be owing.</p>

<p>The finest specimens of antique sculpture
are to be seen in the Vatican. In these
the Greek artists display an unquestionable
superiority over the most successful
efforts of the moderns. For me to attempt
a description of these master-pieces,
which have been described a thousand
times, and imitated as often, without once
having had justice done them, would be
equally vain and superfluous. I confine
myself to a very few observations. The
most insensible of mankind must be struck
with horror at sight of the Laocoon. On
one of my visits to the Vatican, I was accompanied
by two persons, who had never
been there before: one of them is accused
of being perfectly callous to every thing
which does not immediately touch his own
person; the other is a worthy, good man:
the first, after staring for some time with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
marks of terror at the groupe, at length
recovered himself; exclaiming with a
laugh,—“Egad, I was afraid these d——d
serpents would have left the fellows they
are devouring, and made a snap at me;
but I am happy to recollect they are of
marble.”—“I thank you, Sir, most
heartily,” said the other, “for putting
me in mind of that circumstance; till
you mentioned it, I was in agony for
those two youths.”</p>

<p>Nothing can be conceived more admirably
executed than this affecting groupe;
in all probability, it never would have entered
into my own head that it could have
been in any respect improved. But when
I first had the happiness of becoming
acquainted with Mr. Lock, a period
of my life which I shall always recollect
with peculiar pleasure, I remember my
conversing with him upon this subject; and
that Gentleman, after mentioning the execution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of this piece, in the highest terms
of praise, observed that, had the figure of
Laocoon been <i>alone</i>, it would have been
perfect. As a man suffering the most excruciating
bodily pain with becoming fortitude,
it admits of no improvement; his
proportions, his form, his action, his expression,
are exquisite. But when his sons
appear, he is no longer an insulated, suffering
individual, who, when he has met
pain and death with dignity, has done all
that could be expected from man; he
commences <i>father</i>, and a much wider field
is opened to the artist. We expect the
deepest pathos in the exhibition of the sublimest
character that art can offer to the
contemplation of the human mind: A father
forgetting pain, and instant death, to
save his children. This Sublime and Pathetic
the artist either did not see, or despaired
of attaining. Laocoon’s sufferings
are merely corporal; he is deaf to the cries
of his agonizing children, who are calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
on him for assistance. But had he been
throwing a look of anguish upon his sons,
had he seemed to have forgotten his own
sufferings in theirs, he would have commanded
the sympathy of the spectator in a
much higher degree. On the whole, Mr.
Lock was of opinion, that the execution of
this groupe is perfect, but that the conception
is not equal to the execution. I shall
leave it to others to decide whether Mr.
Lock, in these observations, spoke like a
man of taste: I am sure he spoke like a father.
I have sensibility to feel the beauty
and justness of the remark, though I had
not the ingenuity to make it.</p>

<p>It is disputed whether this groupe was
formed from Virgil’s description of the
death of Laocoon and his sons, or the description
made from the groupe; it is evident,
from their minute resemblance, that
one or other must have been the case. The
Poet mentions a circumstance, which could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
not be represented by the sculptor; he says
that, although every other person around
sought safety by flight, the father was attacked
by the serpents, while he was advancing
to the assistance of his sons—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">—auxilio subeuntem ac tela ferentem.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This deficiency in the sculptor’s art would
have been finely supplied by the improvement
which Mr. Lock proposed.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the dreadful condition of
three persons entangled in the horrid twinings
of serpents, and after contemplating
the varied anguish so strongly expressed in
their countenances, it is a relief to turn the
eye to the heavenly figure of the Apollo.
To form an adequate idea of the beauty of
this statue, it is absolutely necessary to see
it. With all the advantages of colour
and life, the human form never appeared
so beautiful; and we never can sufficiently
admire the artist, who has endowed marble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
with a finer expression of grace, dignity,
and understanding, than ever were seen in
living features. In the forming of this inimitable
figure, the artist seems to have
wrought after an ideal form of beauty, superior
to any in nature, and which existed
only in his own imagination.</p>

<p>The admired statue of Antinous is in the
same Court. Nothing can be more light,
elegant, and easy; the proportions are exact,
and the execution perfect. It is an
exquisite representation of the most beautiful
youth that ever lived.</p>

<p>The statue of Apollo represents something
superior, and the emotions it excites
are all of the sublime cast.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XLVII">LETTER XLVII.</h2>

<p class="right">Rome.</p>

<p>The present Pope, who has assumed
the name of Pius the Sixth, is a
tall, well-made man, about sixty years of
age, but retaining in his look all the freshness
of a much earlier period of life. He
lays a greater stress on the ceremonious
part of religion than his predecessor Ganganelli,
in whose reign a great relaxation
of church-discipline is thought to have
taken place. The late Pope was a man of
moderation, good sense, and simplicity of
manners; and could not go through all
the ostentatious parade which his station
required, without reluctance, and marks of
disgust. He knew that the opinions of
mankind had undergone a very great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
change since those ceremonies were established;
and that some of the most respectable
of the spectators considered as perfectly
frivolous many things which formerly
had been held as sacred. A man of good
sense may seem to lay the greatest weight
on ceremonies which he himself considers
as ridiculous, provided he thinks the people,
in whose sight he goes through them,
are impressed with a conviction of their
importance; but if he knows that some of
the beholders are entirely of a different
way of thinking, he will be strongly
tempted to evince, by some means or other,
that he despises the fooleries he performs,
as much as any of them. This, in all
probability, was the case with Ganganelli;
who, besides, was an enemy to fraud and
hypocrisy of every kind. But, however
remiss he may have been with regard to the
etiquette of his spiritual functions, every
body acknowledges his diligence and activity
in promoting the temporal good of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
subjects. He did all in his power to revive
trade, and to encourage manufactures and
industry of every kind. He built no
churches, but he repaired the roads all over
the ecclesiastical state; he restrained the
malevolence of bigots, removed absurd
prejudices, and promoted sentiments of
charity and good-will to mankind in general,
without excepting even heretics. His
enemies, the Jesuits, with an intention to
make him odious in the eyes of his own
subjects, gave him the name of the Protestant
Pope. If they supposed that this calumny
would be credited, on account of the
conduct above mentioned, they at once paid
the highest compliment to the Pope and the
Protestant religion. The careless manner
in which Ganganelli performed certain
functions, and the general tenour of his
life and sentiments, were lamented by politicians,
as well as by bigots. However
frivolous the former might think many ceremonies
in themselves, they still considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
them as of political importance, in such a government
as that of Rome; and the Conclave
held on the death of the late Pope,
are thought to have been in some degree
influenced by such considerations in chusing
his successor. The present Pope, before
he was raised to that dignity, was
considered as a firm believer in all the tenets
of the Roman Church, and a strict and
scrupulous observer of all its injunctions
and ceremonials. As his pretensions, in
point of family, fortune, and connexions,
were smaller than those of most of his brother
cardinals, it is the more probable that
he owed his elevation to this part of his
character, which rendered him a proper
person to check the progress of abuses that
had been entirely neglected by the late
Pope; under whose administration free-thinking
was said to have been countenanced,
Protestantism in general regarded
with diminished abhorrence, and the Calvinists
in particular treated with a degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of indulgence, to which their inveterate
enmity to the church of Rome gave them
no title. Several instances of this are enumerated,
and one in particular, which, I
dare say, you will think a stronger proof
of the late Pope’s good sense and good humour,
than of that negligence to which
his enemies imputed it.</p>

<p>A Scotch presbyterian having heated his
brain, by reading the Book of Martyrs,
the cruelties of the Spanish Inquisition,
and the Histories of all the persecutions
that ever were raised by the Roman Catholics
against the Protestants, was seized
with a dread, that the same horrors were
just about to be renewed. This terrible idea
disturbed his imagination day and night;
he thought of nothing but racks and scaffolds;
and, on one occasion, he dreamt that
there was a continued train of bonfires,
with a tar-barrel and a Protestant in each,
all the way from Smithfield to St. Andrews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>He communicated the anxiety and distress
of his mind to a worthy sensible clergyman
who lived in the neighbourhood.
This gentleman took great pains to quiet
his fears, proving to him, by strong and
obvious arguments, that there was little or
no danger of such an event as he dreaded.
These reasonings had a powerful effect
while they were delivering, but the impression
did not last, and was always effaced
by a few pages of the Book of Martyrs.
As soon as the clergyman remarked
this, he advised the relations to remove
that, and every book which treated of
persecution or martyrdom, entirely out of
the poor man’s reach. This was done accordingly,
and books of a less gloomy
complexion were substituted in their place;
but as all of them formed a strong contrast
with the colour of his mind, he could not
bear their perusal, but betook himself to
the study of the Bible, which was the only
book of his ancient library which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
been left; and so strong a hold had his
former studies taken of his imagination,
that he could relish no part of the Bible,
except the Revelation of St. John, a great
part of which, he thought, referred to
the whore of Babylon, or in other words,
the Pope of Rome. This part of the
scripture he perused continually with unabating
ardor and delight. His friend the
clergyman, having observed this, took occasion
to say, that every part of the Holy
Bible was, without doubt, most sublime,
and wonderfully instructive; yet he was
surprised to see that he limited his studies
entirely to the last book, and neglected all
the rest. To which the other replied,
That <i>he</i> who was a divine, and a man of
learning, might, with propriety, read all
the sacred volume from beginning to end;
but, for his own part, he thought proper
to confine himself to what he could understand;
and <i>therefore</i>, though he had a
due respect for all the scripture, he acknowledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
he gave a preference to the
Revelation of St. John. This answer entirely
satisfied the clergyman; he did not
think it expedient to question him any
farther; he took his leave, after having
requested the people of the family with
whom this person lived, to have a watchful
eye on their relation. In the mean time,
this poor man’s terrors, with regard to the
revival of popery and persecution, daily
augmented; and nature, in all probability,
would have sunk under the weight of
such accumulated anxiety, had not a
thought occurred which relieved his mind
in an instant, by suggesting an infallible
method of preventing all the evils which
his imagination had been brooding over
for so long a time. The happy idea
which afforded him so much comfort, was
no other, than that he should immediately
go to Rome, and convert the Pope from
the Roman Catholic to the Presbyterian
religion. The moment he hit on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
fortunate expedient, he felt at once the
strongest impulse to undertake the task,
and the fullest conviction that his undertaking
would be crowned with success; it
is no wonder, therefore, that his countenance
threw off its former gloom, and
that all his features brightened with the
heart-felt thrillings of happiness and
self-applause. While his relations congratulated
each other on this agreeable
change, the exulting visionary, without
communicating his design to any mortal,
set out for London, took his passage to
Leghorn, and, in a short time after, arrived
in perfect health of body, and in exalted
spirits, at Rome.</p>

<p>He directly applied to an ecclesiastic of
his own country, of whose obliging temper
he had previously heard, and whom
he considered as a proper person to procure
him an interview necessary for the accomplishment
of his project. He informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that gentleman, that he earnestly wished
to have a conference with the Pope, on a
business of infinite importance, and which
admitted of no delay. It was not difficult
to perceive the state of this poor man’s mind;
the good-natured ecclesiastic endeavoured
to sooth and amuse him, putting off the
conference till a distant day; in hopes that
means might be fallen on, during the interval,
to prevail on him to return to his
own country. A few days after this,
however, he happened to go to St. Peter’s
church, at the very time when his Holiness
was performing some religious ceremony.
At this sight our impatient missionary
felt all his passions inflamed with irresistible
ardour; he could no longer wait
for the expected conference, but bursting
out with zealous indignation, he exclaimed,
“O thou beast of nature, with seven
heads and ten horns! thou mother of
harlots, arrayed in purple and scarlet,
and decked with gold and precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
stones and pearls! throw away the golden
cup of abominations, and the filthiness
of thy fornication!”</p>

<p>You may easily imagine the astonishment
and hubbub that such an apostrophe,
from such a person, in such a place, would
occasion; he was immediately carried to
prison by the Swiss halberdiers.</p>

<p>When it was known that he was a British
subject, some who understood English
were ordered to attend his examination.
The first question asked of him was, “What
had brought him to Rome?” He answered,
“To anoint the eyes of the scarlet whore
with eye-salve, that she might see her
wickedness.” They asked, “Who he
meant by the scarlet whore?” He answered,
“Who else could he mean, but her who
sitteth upon seven mountains, who hath
seduced the kings of the earth to commit
fornication, and who hath gotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
drunk with the blood of the saints, and
the blood of the martyrs?” Many other
questions were asked, and such provoking
answers returned, that some suspected the
man affected madness, that he might give
vent to his rancour and petulance with
impunity; and they were for condemning
him to the gallies, that he might be taught
more sense, and better manners. But
when they communicated their sentiments to
Clement the Fourteenth, he said, with great
good humour, “That he never had heard
of any body whose understanding, or
politeness, had been much improved at
that school; that although the poor
man’s first address had been a little rough
and abrupt, yet he could not help considering
himself as obliged to him for
his good intentions, and for his undertaking
such a long journey with a view
to do good.” He afterwards gave orders
to treat the man with gentleness
while he remained in confinement, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to put him on board the first ship bound
from Civita Vecchia to England, defraying
the expence of his passage. However
humane and reasonable this conduct may
be thought by many, there were people
who condemned it as an injudicious piece
of lenity, which might have a tendency
to sink the dignity of the sacred office, and
expose it to future insults. If such behaviour
as this did not pass without blame,
it may be easily supposed, that few of the
late Pope’s actions escaped uncensured;
and many who loved the easy amiable
dispositions of the man, were of opinion,
that the spirit of the times required a different
character on the Papal throne.
This idea prevailed among the Cardinals
at the late election, and the Conclave is
supposed to have fixed on Cardinal Braschi
to be Pope, from the same motive that
the Roman senate sometimes chose a Dictator
to restore and enforce the ancient discipline.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_XLVIII">LETTER XLVIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Rome.</p>

<p>Pius the Sixth performs all the religious
functions of his office in the
most solemn manner; not only on public
and extraordinary occasions, but also in
the most common acts of devotion. I
happened lately to be at St. Peter’s church,
when there was scarcely any other body
there; while I lounged from chapel to
chapel, looking at the sculpture and paintings,
the Pope entered with a very few attendants;
when he came to the statue of
St. Peter, he was not satisfied with bowing,
which is the usual mark of respect
shewn to that image; or with kneeling,
which is performed by more zealous persons;
or with kissing the foot, which I formerly
imagined concluded the climax of devotion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
he bowed, he knelt, he kissed the foot,
and then he rubbed his brow and his whole
head with every mark of humility, fervour,
and adoration, upon the sacred
stump.—It is no more, one half of the
foot having been long since worn away
by the lips of the pious; and if the example
of his Holiness is universally imitated,
nothing but a miracle can prevent
the leg, thigh, and other parts from
meeting with the same fate. This uncommon
appearance of zeal in the Pope, is
not imputed to hypocrisy or to policy, but
is supposed to proceed entirely from a conviction
of the efficacy of those holy frictions;
an opinion which has given people
a much higher idea of the strength of his
faith, than of his understanding. This
being jubilee year, he may possibly think
a greater appearance of devotion necessary
now, than at any other time. The first
jubilee was instituted by Boniface the
Eighth, in the year 1300. Many ceremonies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and institutions of the Roman
Catholic church are founded on those of
the old Heathens. This is evidently an
imitation of the Roman secular games,
which were exhibited every hundredth
year in honour of the gods<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>; they lasted
three days and three nights; they were
attended with great pomp, and drew vast
numbers of people to Rome, from all parts
of Italy, and the most distant provinces.
Boniface, recollecting this, determined to
institute something analogous, which
would immortalize his own name, and
promote the interest of the Roman Catholic
religion in general, and that of the
city of Rome in particular. He embraced
the favourable opportunity which the beginning
of a century presented; he invented
a few extraordinary ceremonies, and
declared the year 1300 the first jubilee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
year, during which he assured mankind,
that heaven would be in a particular manner
propitious, in granting indulgences, and
remission of sins, to all who should come to
Rome, and attend the functions there to
be performed, at this fortunate period,
which was not to occur again for a hundred
years. This drew a great concourse
of wealthy sinners to Rome; and the extraordinary
circulation of money it occasioned,
was strongly felt all over the Pope’s
dominions. Clement the Sixth, regretting
that these advantages should occur so seldom,
abridged the period, and declared
there would be a jubilee every fifty years;
the second was accordingly celebrated in
the year 1350. Sixtus the Fifth, imagining
that the interval was still too long,
once more retrenched the half; and ever
since there has been a jubilee every twenty-fifth
year<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. It is not likely that any future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Pope will think of shortening this
period; if any alteration were again to
take place, it most probably would be, to
restore the ancient period of fifty or a
hundred years; for, instead of the wealthy
pilgrims who flocked to Rome from every
quarter of Christendom, ninety-nine in a
hundred of those who come now, are supported
by alms during their journey, or
are barely able to defray their own expences
by the strictest œconomy; and his
Holiness is supposed at present to derive no
other advantage from the uncommon fatigue
he is obliged to go through on the
jubilee year, except the satisfaction he
feels, in reflecting on the benefit his labours
confer on the souls of the beggars,
and other travellers, who resort from all
corners of Italy to Rome, on this blessed
occasion. The States which border on
the Pope’s dominions, suffer many temporal
inconveniencies from the zeal of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
peasants and manufacturers, the greater
part of whom still make a point of visiting
St. Peter’s on the jubilee year; the
loss sustained by the countries which such
emigrants abandon, is not balanced by
any advantage transferred to that to which
they resort; the good arising on the whole,
being entirely of a spiritual nature. By
far the greater number of pilgrims come
from the kingdom of Naples, whose inhabitants
are said to be of a very devout
and very amorous disposition. The first
prompts them to go to Rome in search of
that absolution which the second renders
necessary; and on the year of jubilee,
when indulgences are to be had at an
easier rate than at any other time, those
who can afford it generally carry away
such a stock, as not only is sufficient to
clear old scores, but will also serve as an
indemnifying fund for future transgressions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one door into the church of St.
Peter’s, which is called the Holy Door.
This is always walled up, except on this
distinguished year; and even then no person
is permitted to enter by it, but in the
humblest posture. The pilgrims, and many
others, prefer crawling into the church
upon their knees, by this door; to walking
in, the usual way, by any other. I was
present at the shutting up of this Holy
Door. The Pope being seated on a raised
seat, or kind of throne, surrounded by
Cardinals and other ecclesiastics, an anthem
was sung, accompanied by all sorts of musical
instruments. During the performance,
his Holiness descended from the
throne, with a golden trowel in his hand,
placed the first brick, and applied some
mortar; he then returned to his seat, and
the door was instantly built up by more
expert, though less hallowed, workmen;
and will remain as it is now, till the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the nineteenth century, when
it will be again opened, by the Pope then
in being, with the same solemnity that it
has been now shut. Though his Holiness
places but a single brick, yet it is very remarkable
that this never fails to communicate
its influence, in such a rapid and
powerful manner, that, within about an
hour, or at most an hour and a half, all
the other bricks, which form the wall of
the Holy Door, acquire an equal degree of
sanctity with that placed by the Pope’s own
hands. The common people and pilgrims
are well acquainted with this wonderful
effect. At the beginning of this Jubilee-year,
when the late wall was thrown down,
men, women, and children scrambled and
fought for the fragments of the bricks and
mortar, with the same eagerness which less
enlightened mobs display, on days of public
rejoicing, when handfuls of money are
thrown among them. I have been often
assured that those pieces of brick, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
their sanctity, have also the virtue of curing
many of the most obstinate diseases: and, if
newspapers were permitted at Rome, there is
not the least reason to doubt, that those
cures would be attested publicly by the patients,
in a manner as satisfactory and
convincing as are the cures performed
daily by the pills, powders, drops, and
balsams advertised in the London newspapers.
After the shutting of the Holy
Door, mass was celebrated at midnight;
and the ceremony was attended by vast
multitudes of people. For my own part,
I suspended my curiosity till next day,
which was Christmas-day, when I returned
again to St. Peter’s church, and saw the
Pope perform mass on that solemn occasion.
His Holiness went through all the evolutions
of the ceremony with an address and
flexibility of body, which are rarely to be
found in those who wear the tiara; who
are, generally speaking, men bowing under
the load of years and infirmities. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
present Holiness has hitherto suffered from
neither. His features are regular, and he
has a fine countenance; his person is
straight, and his movements graceful.
His leg and foot are remarkably well made,
and always ornamented with silk stockings,
and red slippers, of the most delicate construction.
Notwithstanding that the papal
uniforms are by no means calculated to set
off the person to the greatest advantage,
yet the peculiar neatness with which they
are put on, and the nice adjustment of their
most minute parts, sufficiently prove that
his present Holiness is not insensible of the
charms of his person, or unsolicitous about
his external ornaments. Though verging
towards the winter of life, his cheeks still
glow with autumnal roses, which, at a little
distance, appear as blooming as those of the
spring. If he himself were less clear-sighted
than he seems to be, to the beauties
of his face and person, he could not also
be deaf to the voices of the women, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
break out into exclamations, in praise of
both, as often as he appears in public. On
a public occasion, lately, as he was carried
through a particular street, a young woman
at a window exclaimed, “Quanto e bello!
O quanto e bello!” and was immediately
answered by a zealous old lady at the window
opposite, who, folding her hands in
each other, and raising her eyes to heaven,
cried out, with a mixture of love for his
person, and veneration for his sacred office,
“Tanto e bello, quanto e santo!” When
we know that such a quantity of incense is
daily burnt under his sacred nostrils, we
ought not to be astonished, though we
should find his brain, on some occasions, a
little intoxicated.</p>

<p>Vanity is a very comfortable failing;
and has such an universal power over
mankind, that not only the gay blossoms
of youth, but even the shrivelled bosom of
age, and the contracted heart of bigotry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
open, expand, and display strong marks of
sensibility under its influence.</p>

<p>After mass, the Pope gave the benediction
to the people assembled in
the Grand Court, before the church of
St. Peter’s. It was a remarkably fine
day; an immense multitude filled that spacious
and magnificent area; the horse and
foot guards were drawn up in their most
showy uniform. The Pope, seated in an
open, portable chair, in all the splendour
which his wardrobe could give, with the
tiara on his head, was carried out of a large
window, which opens on a balcony in the
front of St. Peter’s. The silk hangings and
gold trappings with which the chair was embellished,
concealed the men who carried it;
so that to those who viewed him from the area
below, his Holiness seemed to sail forward,
from the window self-balanced in the air,
like a celestial being. The instant he appeared,
the music struck up, the bells rung from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
every church, and the cannon thundered
from the castle of St. Angelo in repeated
peals. During the intervals, the church of
St. Peter’s, the palace of the Vatican, and
the banks of the Tiber, re-echoed the acclamations
of the populace. At length his
Holiness arose from his seat, and an immediate
and awful silence ensued. The multitude
fell upon their knees, with their
hands and eyes raised towards his Holiness,
as to a benign Deity. After a solemn
pause, he pronounced the benediction,
with great fervour; elevating his outstretched
arms as high as he could; then closing
them together, and bringing them back to
his breast with a slow motion, as if he had
got hold of the blessing, and was drawing
it gently from heaven. Finally, he threw
his arms open, waving them for some time,
as if his intention had been to scatter the
benediction with impartiality among the
people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>No ceremony can be better calculated for
striking the senses, and imposing on the
understanding, than this of the Supreme
Pontiff giving the blessing from the balcony
of St. Peter’s. For my own part, if I had
not, in my early youth, received impressions
highly unfavourable to the chief actor
in this magnificent interlude, I should have
been in danger of paying him a degree of
respect, very inconsistent with the religion
in which I was educated.</p>

<p class="right">Rome.</p>

<p>In my last, I informed you of my having
been seduced almost into idolatry, by
the influence of example, and the pomp
which surrounded the idol. I must now
confess that I have actually bowed the knee
to Baal, from mere wantonness. We are
told that, to draw near to that Being, who
ought to be the only object of worship,
with our lips, while our hearts are far
from him, is a mockery. Such daring and
absurd hypocrisy I shall always avoid: but
to have drawn near to <i>him</i>, who ought
not to be an object of worship, with the
lips only, while the heart continued at a
distance, I hope will be considered as no
more than a venial transgression. In short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
I trust, that it will not be looked on as a
mortal sin in Protestants to have kissed the
Pope’s toe. If it should, some of your
friends are in a deplorable way, as you shall
hear.—It is usual for strangers to be presented
to his Holiness, before they leave
Rome. The D—— of H——, Mr. K——,
and myself, have all been at the Vatican together,
upon that important business. Your
young acquaintance Jack, who, having
now got a commission in the army, considers
himself no longer as a boy, desired
to accompany us. We went under the
auspices of a certain ecclesiastic, who usually
attends the English on such occasions.</p>

<p>He very naturally concluded, that it
would be most agreeable to us to have the
circumstance of kissing the slipper dispensed
with. Having had some conversation,
therefore, with his Holiness, in his own
apartment, while we remained in another
room, previous to our introduction; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
afterwards returned, and informed us, that
the Pontiff, indulgent to the prejudices of
the British nation, did not insist on that
part of the ceremonial; and therefore a
very low bow, on our being presented, was
all that would be required of us.</p>

<p>A bow! cried the D—— of H——; I should
not have given myself any trouble about
the matter, had I suspected that all was to
end in a bow. I look on kissing the toe
as the only amusing circumstance of the
whole; if that is to be omitted, I will not
be introduced at all. For if the most ludicrous
part is left out, who would wait for
the rest of a farce?</p>

<p>This was a thunderstroke to our negociator,
who expected thanks, at least, for
the honourable terms he had obtained; but
who, on the contrary, found himself in the
same disagreeable predicament with other
negociators, who have met with abuse and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
reproach from their countrymen, on account
of treaties for which they expected
universal applause.</p>

<p>The D—— of H—— knew nothing of
the treaty which our introducer had just
concluded; otherwise he would certainly
have prevented the negociation. As I
perceived, however, that our ambassador
was mortified with the thoughts that all
his labour should prove abortive, I said,
that, although he had prevailed with his
Holiness to wave that part of the ceremonial,
which his Grace thought so entertaining,
yet it would unquestionably be still
more agreeable to him that the whole
should be performed to its utmost extent:
this new arrangement, therefore, needed
not be an obstruction to our being presented.</p>

<p>The countenance of our Conductor
brightened up at this proposal. He immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
ushered us into the presence of
the Supreme Pontiff. We all bowed to the
ground; the supplest of the company had
the happiness to touch the sacred slipper
with their lips, and the least agile were
within a few inches of that honour. As
this was more than had been bargained
for, his Holiness seemed agreeably surprised;
raised the D—— with a smiling
countenance, and conversed with him in
an obliging manner, asking the common
questions, How long he had been in Italy?
Whether he found Rome agreeable? When
he intended to set out for Naples?—He
said something of the same kind to each of
the company; and, after about a quarter
of an hour or twenty minutes, we took
our leave.</p>

<p>Next day, his Holiness sent his compliments
to the D——, with a present of two
medals, one of gold, and the other
of silver; on both of which the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of the Pontiff is very accurately engraved.</p>

<p>The manner in which the generality of
sovereign princes pass their time, is as far
from being amusing or agreeable, as one
can possibly imagine. Slaves to the tiresome
routine of etiquette; martyrs to the
oppressive fatigue of pomp; constrained to
walk every levee-day around the same dull
circle, to gratify the vanity of fifty or a
hundred people, by whispering a something
or a nothing into the ears of each; obliged
to wear a smiling countenance, even
when the heart is oppressed with sadness;
besieged by the craving faces of those,
who are more displeased at what is withheld,
than grateful for the favours they
have received; surrounded, as he constantly
is, by adepts in the art of simulation,
all professing the highest possible regard;
how shall the puzzled monarch distinguish
real from assumed attachment?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and what a risk does he run, of placing his
confidence where he ought to have directed
his indignation! And, to all these inconveniencies,
when we add this, that he is
precluded from those delightful sensations
which spring from disinterested friendship,
sweet equality, and the gay, careless enjoyments
of social life, we must acknowledge,
that all that is brilliant in the condition
of a sovereign, is not sufficient to
compensate for such restraints, such dangers,
and such deprivations.</p>

<p>So far indeed are we from considering
that envied condition as enviable, that
great part of mankind are more apt to
think it insupportable; and are surprised
to find, that those unhappy men, whom
fate has condemned to suffer the pains of
royalty for life, are able to wait with patience
for the natural period of their days.
For, strange as it may appear, history does
not furnish us with an instance, not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in Great Britain itself, of a king, who
hanged, or drowned, or put himself to
death in any other violent manner, from
mere tædium, as other mortals, disgusted
with life, are apt to do. I was at a loss to
account for such an extraordinary fact, till
I recollected that, however void of resources
and activity the minds of monarchs
may be, they are seldom allowed
to rest in repose. The storms to
which people in their lofty situation are
exposed, occasion such agitations as prevent
the stagnating slime of tædium from gathering
on their minds. That kings do
not commit suicide, therefore, affords only
a very slender presumption of the happiness
of their condition: although it is a
strong proof, that all the hurricanes of life
are not so insupportable to the human
mind, as that insipid, fearless, hopeless
calm, which envelopes men who are devoid
of mental enjoyments, and whose senses
are palled with satiety. If there is any
truth in the above representation of the regal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
condition, would not you imagine that
of all others it would be the most shunned?
Would not you imagine that every human
being would shrink from it, as from certain
misery; and that at least every wise
man would say, with the Poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I envy none their pageantry and show,</div>
<div class="verse">I envy none the gilding of their woe?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Not only every wise man, but every foolish
man, will adopt the sentiment, and act
accordingly; provided his rank in life removes
him from the possibility of ever attaining
the objects in question. For what
is situated beyond the sphere of our hopes,
very seldom excites our desires; but bring
the powerful magnets a little nearer, and
they attract the human passions with a
force which reason and philosophy cannot
controul. Placed within their reach, the
wise and the foolish grasp with equal eagerness
at crowns and sceptres, in spite of all
the thorns with which they are surrounded.
Their alluring magic seems to have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
power of changing the very characters and
natures of men. In pursuit of them, the
indolent have been excited to the most
active exertions, the voluptuous have renounced
their darling pleasures; and even
those who have long walked in the direct
road of integrity, have deviated into all
the crooked paths of villany and fraud.</p>

<p>There are passions, whose indulgence is
so exceedingly flattering to the natural
vanity of men, that they will gratify them,
though persuaded that the gratification
will be attended by disappointment and
misery. The love of power and sovereignty
is of this class. It has been a general
belief, ever since the kingly office
was established among men, that cares and
anxiety were the constant attendants of
royalty. Yet this general conviction
never made a single person decline an opportunity
of embarking on this sea of
troubles. Every new adventurer flatters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
himself that he shall be guided by some
happy star undiscovered by former navigators;
and those who, after trial, have relinquished
the voyage—Charles, Christina,
Amadeus, and others—when they had quitted
the helm, and were safely arrived in port,
are said to have languished, all the rest
of their lives, for that situation which
their own experience taught them was
fraught with misery.</p>

<p>However eager and impatient this Prince
may have formerly been to obtain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
crown, you would conclude that he was
quite cloyed by possession at the time he
made this speech; and therefore, at first sight,
you would not expect that he should afterwards
display any excessive attachment to
what gives him so much uneasiness. But
Shakespear, who knew the secret wishes,
perverse desires, and strange inconsistencies
of the human heart, better than
man ever knew them, makes this very
Henry so tenaciously fond of that which
he himself considered as the cause of all
his inquietude, that he cannot bear to have
the crown one moment out of his sight,
but orders it to be placed on his pillow
when he lies on his death-bed.</p>

<p>Of all diadems, the Tiara, in my opinion,
has the fewest charms; and nothing
can afford a stronger proof of the strength
and perseverance of man’s passion for sovereign
power, than our knowledge, that
even this ecclesiastical crown is sought after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
with as much eagerness, perhaps with
more, than any other crown in the world,
although the candidates are generally in
the decline of life, and all of a profession
which avows the most perfect contempt of
worldly grandeur. This appears the more
wonderful when we reflect, that, over and
above those sources of weariness and vexation,
which the Pope has in common
with other sovereigns, he has some which
are peculiar to himself.—The tiresome religious
functions which he must perform,
the ungenial solitude of his meals, the exclusion
of the company and conversation
of women, restriction from the tenderest
and most delightful connexions in life,
from the endearments of a parent, and
the <i>open acknowledgment</i> of his own children;
his mind oppressed with the gloomy
reflection, that the man for whom he has
the least regard, perhaps his greatest enemy,
may be his immediate successor; to
which is added, the pain of seeing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
influence, both spiritual and temporal, declining
every day; and the mortification of
knowing, that all his ancient lofty pretensions
are laughed at by one half of the
Roman Catholics, all the Protestants, and
totally disregarded by the rest of mankind.
I know of nothing which can be put in
the other scale to balance all those peculiar
disadvantages which his Holiness labours
under, unless it is the singular felicity
which he lawfully may, and no doubt
does enjoy, in the contemplation of his
own infallibility.</p>

<p class="right">Rome.</p>

<p>In their external deportment, the Italians
have a grave solemnity of manner,
which is sometimes thought to arise from
a natural gloominess of disposition. The
French, above all other nations, are apt
to impute to melancholy, the sedate serious
air which accompanies reflection.</p>

<p>Though in the pulpit, on the theatre,
and even in common conversation, the
Italians make use of a great deal of
action; yet Italian vivacity is different
from French; the former proceeds from
sensibility, the latter from animal spirits.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this country have
not the brisk look, and elastic trip, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
is universal in France; they move rather
with a flow composed pace: their spines
never having been forced into a straight
line, retain the natural bend; and the people
of the most finished fashion, as well
as the neglected vulgar, seem to prefer the
unconstrained attitude of the Antinous,
and other antique statues, to the artificial
graces of a French dancing-master, or the
erect strut of a German soldier. I imagine
I perceive a great resemblance between
many of the living countenances I see
daily, and the features of the ancient
busts and statues; which leads me to believe,
that there are a greater number of
the genuine descendants of the old Romans
in Italy, than is generally imagined.</p>

<p>I am often struck with the fine character
of countenance to be seen in the streets of
Rome. I never saw features more expressive
of reflection, sense, and genius; in the
very lowest ranks there are countenances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
which announce minds fit for the highest
and most important situations; and we cannot
help regretting, that those to whom
they belong, have not received an education
adequate to the natural abilities
we are convinced they possess, and placed
where these abilities could be brought into
action.</p>

<p>Of all the countries in Europe, Switzerland
is that in which the beauties of
nature appear in the greatest variety of
forms, and on the most magnificent scale;
in that country, therefore, the young
landscape painter has the best chance of
seizing the most sublime ideas: but Italy
is the best school for the history painter,
not only on account of its being enriched
with the works of the greatest masters,
and the noblest models of antique sculpture;
but also on account of the fine expressive
style of the Italian countenance.
Here you have few or none of those fair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fat, glistening, unmeaning faces, so common
in the more northern parts of Europe.
I happened once to sit by a foreigner
of my acquaintance at the Opera
in the Hay-market, when a certain Nobleman,
who at that time was a good deal
talked of, entered. I whispered him—“That
is Lord ——.” “Not surely the
famous Lord ——,” said he. “Yes,”
said I, “the very same.” “It must be
acknowledged then,” continued he, “that
the noble Earl does infinite honour to
those who have had the care of his
education.” “How so?” rejoined I.
“Because,” replied the foreigner, “a
countenance so completely vacant,
strongly indicates a deficiency of natural
abilities; the respectable figure he makes
in the senate, I therefore presume must
be entirely owing to instruction.”</p>

<p>Strangers, on their arrival at Rome,
form no high idea of the beauty of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Roman women, from the specimens they
see in the fashionable circles to which they
are first introduced. There are some exceptions;
but in general it must be acknowledged,
that the present race of women
of high rank, are more distinguished by
their other ornaments, than by their
beauty. Among the citizens, however,
and in the lower classes, you frequently
meet with the most beautiful countenances.
For a brilliant red and white, and all the
charms of complexion, no women are
equal to the English. If a hundred, or
any greater number, of English women
were taken at random, and compared with
the same number of the wives and daughters
of the citizens of Rome, I am convinced,
that ninety of the English would
be found handsomer than ninety of the
Romans; but the probability is, that
two or three in the hundred Italians,
would have finer countenances than any
of the English. English beauty is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
remarkable in the country, than in towns;
the peasantry of no country in Europe can
stand a comparison, in point of looks, with
those of England. That race of people
have the conveniencies of life in no other
country in such perfection; they are no
where so well fed, so well defended from
the injuries of the seasons; and no where
else do they keep themselves so perfectly
clean, and free from all the vilifying effects
of dirt. The English country girls,
taken collectively, are, unquestionably, the
handsomest in the world. The female
peasants of most other countries, indeed,
are so hard worked, so ill fed, so much
tanned by the sun, and so dirty, that it is
difficult to know whether they have any
beauty or not. Yet I have been informed,
by some Amateurs, since I came here, that,
in spite of all these disadvantages, they
sometimes find, among the Italian peasantry,
countenances highly interesting, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
which they prefer to all the cherry cheeks
of Lancashire.</p>

<p>Beauty, doubtless, is infinitely varied;
and happily for mankind, their tastes and
opinions, on the subject, are equally various.
Notwithstanding this variety, however,
a style of face, in some measure peculiar
to its own inhabitants, has been
found to prevail in each different nation of
Europe. This peculiar countenance is again
greatly varied, and marked with every degree
of discrimination between the extremes
of beauty and ugliness. I will
give you a sketch of the general style of
the most beautiful female heads in this
country, from which you may judge
whether they are to your taste or not.</p>

<p>A great profusion of dark hair, which
seems to encroach upon the forehead,
rendering it short and narrow; the nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
generally either aquiline, or continued in a
straight line from the lower part of the
brow; a full and short upper lip; by the
way, nothing has a worse effect on a countenance,
than a large interval between the
nose and mouth; the eyes are large, and
of a sparkling black. The black eye certainly
labours under one disadvantage,
which is, that, from the iris and pupil
being of the same colour, the contraction
and dilatation of the latter is not seen, by
which the eye is abridged of half its
powers. Yet the Italian eye is wonderfully
expressive; some people think it says
too much. The complexion, for the most
part, is of a clear brown, sometimes fair,
but very seldom florid, or of that bright
fairness which is common in England and
Saxony. It must be owned, that those
features which have a fine expression of
sentiment and meaning in youth, are more
apt, than less expressive faces, to become
soon strong and masculine. In England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and Germany, the women, a little advanced
in life, retain the appearance of
youth longer than in Italy.</p>

<p>With countenances so favourable for the
pencil, you will naturally imagine, that
portrait painting is in the highest perfection
here. The reverse, however, of
this is true; that branch of the art is in
the lowest estimation all over Italy. In
palaces, the best furnished with pictures,
you seldom see a portrait of the proprietor,
or any of his family. A quarter length of
the reigning Pope is sometimes the only
portrait, of a living person, to be seen in
the whole palace. Several of the Roman
Princes affect to have a room of state,
or audience chamber, in which is a raised
seat like a throne, with a canopy over it.
In those rooms the effigies of the Pontiffs
are hung; they are the work of very inferior
artists, and seldom cost above three
or four sequins. As soon as his Holiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
departs this life, the portrait disappears,
and the face of his successor is in due time
hung up in its stead. This, you will say,
is treating their old sovereign a little unkindly,
and paying no very expensive
compliment to the new; it is not so
œconomical, however, as what was
practised by a certain person. I
shall not inform you whether he was a
Frenchman or an Englishman, but he
certainly was a courtier, and professed the
highest possible regard for all living monarchs;
but considered them as no better
than any other piece of clay when dead.
He had a full length picture of his own
Sovereign in the principal room of his
house; on his majesty’s death, to save
himself the expence of a fresh body, and
a new suit of ermine, he employed a
painter to brush out the face and periwig,
and clap the new King’s head on his grandfather’s
shoulders; which, he declared,
were in the most perfect preservation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
fully able to wear out three or four such
heads as painters usually give in these degenerate
days.</p>

<p>The Italians, in general, very seldom
take the trouble of sitting for their pictures.
They consider a portrait as a piece
of painting, which engages the admiration
of nobody but the person it represents,
or the painter who drew it. Those
who are in circumstances to pay the best
artists, generally employ them in some
subject more universally interesting, than
the representation of human countenances
staring out of a piece of canvas.</p>

<p>Pompeio Battoni is the best Italian
painter now at Rome. His taste
and genius led him to history painting,
and his reputation was originally acquired
in that line; but by far the greater part
of his fortune, whatever that may be, has
flowed through a different channel. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
chief employment, for many years past,
has been painting the portraits of the
young English, and other strangers of fortune,
who visit Rome. There are artists
in England, superior in this, and every
other branch of painting, to Battoni. They,
like him, are seduced from the free walks
of genius, and chained, by interest, to the
servile drudgery of copying faces. Beauty
is worthy of the most delicate pencil; but,
gracious heaven! why should every periwig-pated
fellow, without countenance or
character, insist on seeing his chubby cheeks
on canvas?</p>

<p>“Could you not give a little expression
to that countenance?” said a gentleman
to an eminent English painter, who showed
him a portrait which he had just finished.
“I made that attempt already,” replied
the painter; “but what the picture gained
in expression, it lost in likeness; and by
the time there was a little common sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in the countenance, nobody knew for
whom it was intended. I was obliged,
therefore, to make an entire new picture,
with the face perfectly like, and
perfectly meaningless, as you see it.”</p>

<p>Let the colours for ever remain, which
record the last fainting efforts of Chatham;
the expiring triumph of Wolf; or the indecision
of Garrick, equally allured by the
two contending Muses! But let them perish
and fly from the canvas, which blind
self-love spreads for insipidity and ugliness!
Why should posterity know, that the
first genius of the age, and those whose
pencils were formed to speak to the heart,
and delineate beauteous Nature, were chiefly
employed in copying faces? and many
of them, faces that imitate humanity so
abominably, that, to use Hamlet’s expression,
they seem not the genuine work of
Nature, but of Nature’s journeymen.</p>

<p>To this ridiculous self-love, equally prevalent
among the great vulgar and small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
some of the best painters in France, Germany,
and Great Britain, are obliged for
their subsistence. This creates a suspicion,
that a taste for the real beauties of painting,
is not quite so universal, as a sensibility to
their own personal beauties, among the
individuals of these countries. And nothing
can be a stronger proof of the important
light in which men appear in their
own eyes, and their small importance in
those of others, than the different treatment
which the generality of portraits receive,
during the life, and after the death,
of their constituents. During the first of
these periods, they inhabit the finest apartments
of the houses to which they belong;
they are flattered by the guests, and always
viewed with an eye of complacency by the
landlord. But, after the commencement
of the second, they begin to be neglected;
in a short time are ignominiously thrust up
to the garret; and, to fill up the measure
of their affliction, they finally are thrown
out of doors, in the most barbarous manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
without distinction of rank, age, or
sex. Those of former times are scattered,
like Jews, with their long beards and
brown complexions, all over the face of
the earth; and, even of the present century,
Barons of the most ancient families,
armed cap-a-pee, are to be purchased for
two or three ducats, in most of the towns
of Germany. French Marquises, in full
suits of embroidered velvet, may be had at
Paris still cheaper; and many worshipful
citizens of London are to be seen dangling
on the walls of an auction-room, when they
are scarce cold in their graves.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LI">LETTER LI.</h2>

<p class="right">Rome.</p>

<p>There are no theatrical entertainments
permitted in this city, except
during the Carnival; but they are then
attended with a degree of ardour unknown
in capitals whose inhabitants are under no
such restraint. Every kind of amusement,
indeed, in this gay season, is followed
with the greatest eagerness. The natural
gravity of the Roman citizens is
changed into a mirthful vivacity; and
the serious, sombre city of Rome exceeds
Paris itself in sprightliness and gaiety.
This spirit seems gradually to augment,
from its commencement; and is at
its height in the last week of the six which
comprehend the Carnival. The citizens
then appear in the streets, masked, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the characters of Harlequins, Pantaloons,
Punchinellos, and all the fantastic variety
of a masquerade. This humour spreads to
men, women, and children; descends to
the lowest ranks, and becomes universal.
Even those who put on no mask, and have
no desire to remain unknown, reject their
usual clothes, and assume some whimsical
dress. The coachmen, who are placed in
a more conspicuous point of view than
others of the same rank in life, and who
are perfectly known by the carriages they
drive, generally affect some ridiculous disguise:
Many of them chuse a woman’s
dress, and have their faces painted, and adorned
with patches. However dull these
fellows may be, when in breeches, they
are, in petticoats, considered as the pleasantest
men in the world; and excite much
laughter in every street in which they appear.
I observed to an Italian of my acquaintance,
that, considering the staleness
of the joke, I was surprised at the mirth it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
seemed to raise. “When a whole city,”
answered he, “are resolved to be merry
for a week together, it is exceedingly
convenient to have a few established
jokes ready made; the young laugh at
the novelty, and the old from prescription.
This metamorphosis of the coachmen
is certainly not the most refined
kind of wit; however, it is more harmless
than the burning of heretics, which
formerly was a great source of amusement
to our populace.”</p>

<p>The street, called the Corso, is the great
scene of these masquerades. It is crowded
every night with people of all conditions:
Those of rank come in coaches, or in open
carriages, made on purpose. A kind of
civil war is carried on by the company, as
they pass each other. The greatest mark
of attention you can shew your friends and
acquaintance, is, to throw a handful of
little white balls, resembling sugar-plums,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
full in their faces; and, if they are not
deficient in politeness, they will instantly
return you the compliment. All who wish
to make a figure in the Corso, come well
supplied in this kind of ammunition.</p>

<p>Sometimes two or three open carriages,
on a side, with five or six persons of both
sexes in each, draw up opposite to each
other, and fight a pitched battle. On these
occasions, the combatants are provided
with whole bags full of the small shot above
mentioned, which they throw at each
other, with much apparent fury, till their
ammunition is exhausted, and the field of
battle is as white as snow.</p>

<p>The peculiar dresses of every nation of
the globe, and of every profession, besides
all the fantastic characters usual at masquerades,
are to be seen on the Corso. Those
of Harlequin and Pantaloon are in great
vogue among the men. The citizens
wives and daughters generally affect the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
pomp of women of quality; while their
brothers, or other relations, appear as
train-bearers and attendants. In general,
they seem to delight in characters the most
remote from their own. Young people
assume the long beard, tottering step,
and other concomitants of old age; the
aged chuse the bib and rattle of childhood;
and the women of quality, and women
of the town, appear in the characters of
country maidens, nuns, and vestal virgins.
All endeavour to support the assumed characters,
to the best of their ability; but
none, in my opinion, succeed so well as
those who represent children.</p>

<p>Towards the dusk of the evening, the
horse-race takes place. As soon as this is
announced, the coaches, cabriolets, triumphal
cars, and carriages of every kind,
are drawn up, and line the street; leaving
a space in the middle for the racers to pass.
These are five or six horses, trained on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
purpose for this diversion; they are drawn
up a-breast in the Piazza del Popolo, exactly
where the Corso begins. Certain
balls, with little sharp spikes, are hung
along their sides, which serve to spur them
on. As soon as they begin to run, those
animals, by their impatience to be gone,
shew that they understand what is required
of them, and that they take as much pleasure
as the spectators in the sport. A
broad piece of canvas, spread across the
entrance of the street, prevents them from
starting too soon: the dropping that canvas
is the signal for the race to begin. The
horses fly off together, and, without riders,
exert themselves to the utmost; impelled
by emulation, the shouts of the populace,
and the spurs above mentioned. They run
the whole length of the Corso; and the
proprietor of the victor is rewarded by a
certain quantity of fine scarlet or purple
cloth, which is always furnished by the
Jews.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>This diversion, such as it is, seems
highly entertaining to the Roman populace;
though it appears a mighty foolish
business in the eyes of Englishmen. An
acquaintance of mine, who had entirely
ruined a fine fortune at Newmarket, told
me, that Italian horse-races were the most
absurd things in the world; that there
were not a hundred guineas lost or won
during a whole Carnival; and nothing
could be a greater proof of the folly of the
people, than their spending their time in
such a silly manner.</p>

<p>Masking and horse-races are confined to
the last eight days; but there are theatrical
entertainments, of various kinds, during
the whole six weeks of the Carnival.
The Serious Opera is most frequented by
people of fashion, who generally take
boxes for the whole season. The opera,
with which this theatre opened, was
received with the highest applause, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the music only was new. The Italians do
not think it always necessary to compose
new words for what is called a new opera;
they often satisfy themselves with new
music to the affecting dramas of Metastasio.
The audience here seem to lend a
more profound and continued attention
to the music, than at Venice. This is
probably owing to the entertainment being
a greater rarity in the one city than in the
other; for I could perceive that the people
of fashion, who came every night, began,
after the opera had been repeated several
nights, to abate in their attention, to receive
visitors in their boxes, and to listen
only when some favourite airs were singing:
whereas the audience in the pit uniformly
preserve the most perfect silence,
which is only interrupted by gentle murmurs
of pleasure from a few individuals,
or an universal burst of applause from the
whole assembly. I never saw such genuine
marks of satisfaction displayed by any assembly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
on any occasion whatever. The
sensibility of some of the audience gave me
an idea of the power of sounds, which the
dulness of my own auditory nerves could
never have conveyed to my mind. At certain
airs, silent enjoyment was expressed in
every countenance; at others, the hands
were clasped together, the eyes half shut,
and the breath drawn in, with a prolonged
sigh, as if the soul was expiring in a torrent
of delight. One young woman, in
the pit, called out, “O Dio, dove sono!
che piacer via caccia l’alma?”</p>

<p>On the first night of the opera, after
one of these favourite airs, an universal
shout of applause took place, intermingled
with demands that the composer of the
music should appear. Il Maestro! il Maestro!
resounded from every corner of the
house. He was present, and led the band
of music; he was obliged to stand upon
the bench, where he continued, bowing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the spectators, till they were tired of applauding
him. One person, in the middle
of the pit, whom I had remarked displaying
great signs of satisfaction from the beginning
of the performance, cried out,
“He deserves to be made chief musician
to the Virgin, and to lead a choir of
angels!” This expression would be
thought strong, in any country; but it has
peculiar energy here, where it is a popular
opinion, that the Virgin Mary is very fond,
and an excellent judge, of music. I received
this information on Christmas morning,
when I was looking at two poor Calabrian
pipers doing their utmost to please
her, and the Infant in her arms. They
played for a full hour to one of her images
which stands at the corner of a street. All
the other statues of the Virgin, which are
placed in the streets, are serenaded in the
same manner every Christmas morning.
On my enquiring into the meaning of that
ceremony, I was told the above-mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
circumstance of her character, which,
though you may have always thought
highly probable, perhaps you never before
knew for certain. My informer was
a pilgrim, who stood listening with great
devotion to the pipers. He told me, at
the same time, that the Virgin’s taste was
too refined to have much satisfaction in
the performance of those poor Calabrians,
which was chiefly intended for the Infant;
and he desired me to remark, that the
tunes were plain, simple, and such as
might naturally be supposed agreeable to
the ear of a child of his time of life.</p>

<p>Though the serious opera is in highest
estimation, and more regularly attended
by people of the first fashion; yet the
opera buffas, or burlettas, are not entirely
neglected, even by them, and are
crowded, every night, by the middle and
lower classes. Some admired singers have
performed there during the Carnival, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the musical composers have rendered them
highly pleasing to the general taste.</p>

<p>The serious and burlesque operas prevail
infinitely over the other theatrical entertainments
at Rome, in spite of the
united efforts of Harlequin, Pantaloon, and
Punchinello.</p>

<p>The prohibition of female performers
renders the amusement of the Roman
theatre very insipid, in the opinion of
some unrefined Englishmen of your acquaintance
who are here. In my own
poor opinion, the natural sweetness of the
female voice is ill supplied by the artificial
trills of wretched castratos; and the
aukward agility of robust sinewy fellows
dressed in women’s clothes, is a most deplorable
substitution for the graceful movements
of elegant female dancers. Is not the horrid
practice which is encouraged by this manner
of supplying the place of female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
singers, a greater outrage on religion and
morality, than can be produced by the
evils which their prohibition is intended to
prevent? Is it possible to believe, that
purity of sentiment will be preserved by
producing eunuchs on the stage? I should
fear it would have a different effect. At
the funeral of Junia, the wife of Cassius,
and sister of Brutus, the statues of all the
great persons connected with her family
by blood or alliance, were carried in procession,
except those of her brother and
husband. This <i>deficiency</i> struck the people
more than any part of the procession, and
brought the two illustrious Romans into
their minds with more force than if their
statues had been carried with the others.—Præfulgebant
Cassius atque Brutus, says
Tacitus, eo ipso, quod effigies eorum non
visebantur.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LII">LETTER LII.</h2>

<p class="right">Naples.</p>

<p>I take the first opportunity of informing
you of our arrival in this
city. Some of the principal objects which
occurred on the road, with the sentiments
they suggested to my mind, shall form the
subject of this letter.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to go out of the
walls of Rome, without being impressed
with melancholic ideas. Having left that
city by St. John de Lateran’s gate, we soon
entered a spacious plain, and drove for
several miles in sight of sepulchral monuments
and the ruins of ancient aqueducts.
Sixtus the Fifth repaired one of them, to
bring water into that part of Rome where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Dioclesian’s baths formerly stood: this
water is now called <i>aqua felice</i>, from Felix,
the name of that pontiff, while he was
only a Cordelier. Having changed horses
at the Torre de Mezzo Via, so called from
an old tower near the post-house, we proceeded
through a silent, deserted, unwholesome
country. We scarce met a passenger
between Rome and Marino, a little town
about twelve miles from the former, which
has its name from Caius Marius, who had
a villa there; it now belongs to the Colonna
family. While fresh horses were
harnessing, we visited two churches, to see
two pictures which we had heard commended;
the subject of one is as disagreeable,
as that of the other is difficult to
execute. The connoisseur who directed us
to these pieces, told me, that the first, the
slaying of St. Bartholomew, by Guercino,
is in a great style, finely coloured, and the
muscles convulsed with pain in the sweetest
manner imaginable; he could have gazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
at it for ever. “As for the other,” added
he “which represents the Trinity, it is natural,
well grouped, and easily understood;
and that is all that can be said
for it.”</p>

<p>From Marino, the road runs for several
miles over craggy mountains. In ascending
Mons Albanus, we were charmed with a
fine view of the country towards the sea;
Ostia, Antium, the lake Albano, and the
fields adjacent. The form and component
parts of this mountain plainly shew, that
it has formerly been a volcano. The lake
of Nemi, which we left to the right, seems,
like that of Albano, to have been formed
in the cavity of a crater.</p>

<p>We came next to Veletri, an inconsiderable
town, situated on a hill. There is
one palace here, with spacious gardens,
which, when kept in repair, may have
been magnificent. The staircase, they assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
us, is still worthy of admiration.
The inhabitants of Veletri assert, that
Augustus was born there. Suetonius says,
he was born at Rome. It is certainly of
no importance where he was born. Perhaps
it would have been better for Rome,
and for the world in general, that he
never had been born at all. The Veletrians
are so fond of emperors, that they
claim a connexion even with Tiberius and
Caligula, who had villas in their neighbourhood.
The ruins of Otho’s palace are
still to be seen about a mile from this
city, at a place called Colle Ottone. Of
those four emperors, the last-mentioned
was by much the best worth the claiming
as a countryman. As for Caligula, he was
a mischievous madman. Tiberius seems
to have been born with wicked dispositions,
which he improved by art. Augustus was
naturally wicked, and artificially virtuous;
and Otho seems to have been exactly the
reverse. Though educated in the most vicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of courts, and the favourite and
companion of Nero, he still preserved, in
some degree, the original excellence of
his character; and, at his death, displayed
a magnanimity of sentiment, and nobleness
of conduct, of which the highly
flattered Augustus was never capable.
“Alii diutius imperium tenuerint,” says
Tacitus; “nemo tam fortiter reliquerit.”
Convinced that, if he continued the contest
with Vitellius, all the horrors of a civil
war would be prolonged, he determined to
sacrifice his life to the quiet of his country,
and to the safety of his friends<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. “To involve
you in fresh calamities,” said this
generous prince to the officers who offered
still to support his cause, “is purchasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
life at a price beyond what, in my opinion,
is its value. Shall Roman armies
be led against each other, and the Roman
youth be excited to mutual slaughter, on
my account? No! for your safety, and
to prevent such evils, I die contented.
Let me be no impediment to your treating
with the enemy; nor do you any
longer oppose my fixed resolution. I
complain not of my fate, nor do I accuse
any body. To arraign the conduct
of gods or men, is natural to those only
who wish to live.”</p>

<p>Though they are not to be compared in
other respects, yet the <i>death</i> of Otho may
vie with that of Cato; and is one of the
strongest instances to be found in history,
that a life of effeminacy and voluptuousness
does not always eradicate the seeds
of virtue and benevolence.</p>

<p>In the middle of the square of Veletri,
is a bronze statue of Urban the Eighth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
I think they told us it is the workmanship
of Bernini.</p>

<p>Descending from that town by a rough
road, bordered by vineyards and fruit-trees,
we traversed an unsalubrious plain
to Sermonetta; between which, and the
post-house, called Casa Nuova, a little to
the left of the highway, are some vaults
and ruins, not greatly worthy of the
notice of the mere antiquarian. Yet
passengers of a singular cast of mind,
who feel themselves as much interested in
the transactions recorded in the New Testament,
as men of taste are in paintings or
heathen antiquities, stop a little here to
contemplate the <i>Tres Tabernæ</i>, which are
said to be the three Taverns mentioned in the
Acts of the Apostles, where the Christian
brethren from Rome came to meet St.
Paul, when he was on his journey to that
city. I have seen, however, some Christian
travellers, who, without being connoisseurs,
were of opinion, that old ruined
houses derived little value from the circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
above mentioned, and who preferred
a good modern inn to all the
antiquities, sacred or profane, that they
met with on their grand tours. Without
presuming to blame any set of men for
their particular taste, I may venture to say,
that a traveller, who loves always to see a
well-peopled and well-cultivated country,
who insists on good eating every day, and
a neat comfortable bed every night, would
judge very wisely in never travelling out
of England.—I am certain he ought not to
travel between Rome and Naples; for on
this road, especially the part which runs
through the Ecclesiastical State, the traveller’s
chief entertainment must arise from a less
substantial foundation; from the ideas
formed in the mind, at sight of places
celebrated by favourite authors; from a
recollection of the important scenes which
have been acted there; and even from the
thought of treading the same ground, and
viewing the same objects, with certain
persons who lived there fifteen hundred or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
two thousand years ago. Strangers, therefore,
who come under the first description,
whose senses are far more powerful than
their fancy, when they are so ill advised as
to come so far from home, generally make
this journey in very ill humour, fretting at
Italian beds, fuming against Italian cooks,
and execrating every poor little Italian flea
that they meet with on the road. But he
who can put up with indifferent fare cheerfully,
whose serenity of temper remains
unshaken by the assaults of a flea, and who
can draw amusement from the stores of
memory and imagination, will find the
powers of both wonderfully excited during
this journey. Sacred history unites with
profane, truth conspires with fable, to afford
him entertainment, and render every object
interesting.</p>

<p class="noindent">This abode of the enchantress Circe has
been generally described as an island;
whereas it is, in reality, a promontory,
united to the continent by a neck of land.
The adventures of Ulysses and his companions
at this place, with all the extraordinary
things which Homer has recorded
of Circe, must serve to amuse you between
Casa Nuova and Piperno; the road
affords no other.</p>

<p>At Piperno, anciently Privernum, you
quit Circe, for Virgil’s Camilla, a lady of
a very different character, whose native
city this is<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>Near to Piperno, an abbey, called Fossa
Nuova, is situated on the ruins of the
little town of Forum Appii, the same of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
which mention is made in the Acts of the
Apostles, and by Horace, in his account of

<p>The abbey of Fossa Nuova is said to
have made a very valuable acquisition of
late, no less than the head of St. Thomas
Aquinas. We are told, in the memoirs of
that Saint, that he was taken ill as he passed
this way, and was carried to this convent,
where he died. His body was afterward
required by the king of France, and ordered
to be carried to Thoulouse; but before the
remains of this holy person were removed
from the convent, one of the monks, unwilling
to allow the whole of such a
precious deposite to be carried away, determined
to retain the most valuable part,
and actually cut off the saint’s head, substituting
another in its stead, which was
carried to Thoulouse, very nicely stitched to
the body of the saint. The monk, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
was guilty of this pious fraud, hid the
true head in the wall of the convent, and
died without revealing the secret to any
mortal. From that time the supposititious
head remained unsuspected at Thoulouse;
but as impostures are generally detected
sooner or later, the venerable brethren of
Fossa Nuova (this happened much about
the time that the Cock-lane ghost made
such a noise in London) were disturbed
with strange knockings and scratchings at
a particular part of the wall.—On this
noise being frequently repeated, without
any visible agent, and the people of the
neighbourhood having been often assembled
to hear it, the monks at length agreed
to pull down part of the wall at the place
where the scratching and knocking were
always heard. This was no sooner done,
than the true head of St. Thomas Aquinas
was found as fresh as the day it was cut
off;—on the vessel in which it was contained
was the following inscription:</p>

<p class="center">Caput divi Thomæ Aquinatis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>And near it a paper, containing a faithful
narrative of the whole transaction, signed
by the monk who did the deed.</p>

<p>Some people, not making a proper
allowance for the difference between a
saint’s head and their own, say, this cannot
possibly be the head of Thomas
Aquinas, which must have putrified some
centuries ago; they say, the paper is written
in a character by much too modern; they
say, the monks contrived the whole affair,
to give an importance to their convent;
they say—but what signifies what they
say? In this age of incredulity, some people
will say any thing. We next came to
Terracina, and here I must finish my letter;
in my next I shall carry you to
Naples.</p>

<p>Terracina, formerly called Anxur, was
the capital of the warlike Volsci<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.
The principal church was originally a
temple of Jupiter, who was supposed to
have a partiality for this town, and the
country around it. Virgil calls him Jupiter
Anxurus. Enumerating the troops
who came to support the cause of Turnus,
he mentions those who plough the Rutulian
hills:</p>

<p>Near this place we fell in again with the
Appian Way, and beheld, with astonishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the depth of rock that has here
been cut, to render it more convenient for
passengers. This famous road is a paved
causeway, begun in the year of Rome 441,
by Appius Claudius Cæcus the Censor, and
carried all the way from Rome to Capua. It
would be superfluous to insist on the substantial
manner in which it has been originally
made, since it still remains in many places.
Though travellers are now obliged to make
a circuit by Casa Nuova and Piperno, the
Via Appia was originally made in a straight
line through the Palude Pontine, or Palus
Pomptina, as that vast marsh was anciently
called: it is the Ater Palus above mentioned,
in the lines quoted from Virgil.
That part of the Appian road is now quite
impassable, from the augmentation of this
noxious marsh, whose exhalations are disagreeable
to passengers, and near which it
is dangerous to sleep a single night.</p>

<p>Keysler and some others say, that Appius
made this road at his own expence. I
do not know on what authority they make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
this assertion; but, whatever their authority
may be, the thing is incredible.
Could a Roman citizen, at a period when
the inhabitants of Rome were not rich,
bear an expence which we are surprised
that even the State itself could support?
Though this famous road has received its
name from Appius, I can hardly imagine
it was completed by him. The distance
from Rome to Capua is above one hundred
and thirty miles; a prodigious length for
such a road as this to have been made,
during the short course of one Censorship;
for a man could be Censor only once in his
life. This was an office of very great dignity;
no person could enjoy it till he had
previously been Consul. It was originally
held for five years; but, a hundred years
before the time of Appius, the term was
abridged to eighteen months. He, however,
who, as Livy tells us, possessed all
the pride and obstinacy of his family,
refused to quit the Censorship at the end
of that period; and, in spite of all the efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of the Tribunes, continued three
years and a half beyond the term to which
the office had been restricted by the Æmilian
Law. But even five years is a very
short time for so great a work; yet this
was not the only work he carried on during
his Censorship. “Viam munivit,”
says the Historian, “et aquam in urbem
duxit.” The Appian road was carried
on, afterwards, from Capua to Brundusium,
and was probably completed so far,
in the time of Horace; as appears by this
verse, in one of his Epistles addressed to
Lollius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Brundusium Numici melius via ducat, an Appi.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Terracina is the last town of the Ecclesiastical,
and Fundi the first of the Neapolitan,
dominions. This last town stands
on a plain, sheltered by hills, which is
seldom the case with Italian towns: it probably
derives its name from its situation.
There is nothing very attractive in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
place, now, more than in Horace’s time;
so we left it as willingly as he did:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Continuing our route, partly on the Appian
way, we came to Mola di Gaeta, a
town built on the ruins of the ancient
Formiæ. Horace compliments Ælius Lamia,
on his being descended from the first
founder of this city:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Auctore ab illo ducis originem,</div>
<div class="verse">Qui Formiarum mœnia dicitur,</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The same Poet puts the wine, made from
the grapes of the Formian hills, on a
footing with the Falernian:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">

</div>

<p>Cicero had a villa near this place; and
it was on this coast where that great orator
was murdered in his litter, as he was endeavouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to make his escape to Greece.
The fortress of Gaeta is built on a promontory,
about three miles from Mola;
but travellers, who have the curiosity to
go to the former, generally cross the
gulph between the two; and immediately,
as the most remarkable thing in the
place, they are shewn a great cleft in
a rock, and informed that it was miraculously
split in this manner at the death
of our Saviour. To put this beyond doubt,
they shew, at the same time, something
like the impression of a man’s hand on the
rock, of which the following account is
given.—A certain person having been told
on what occasion the rent took place,
struck the palm of his hand on the marble,
declaring he could no more believe their
story, than that his hand would leave its
stamp on the rock; on which, to the terror
and confusion of this infidel, the stone
yielded like wax, and the impression remains
till this day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing is so injurious to the cause of
truth, as attempts to support it by fiction.
Many evidences of the justness of this observation
occur in the course of a tour
through Italy. That mountains were rent
at the death of our Saviour, we know from
the New Testament; but, as none of them
are there particularized, it is presumptuous
in others to imagine they can point out what
the Evangelists have thought proper to
conceal.</p>

<p>This rock, however, is much resorted
to by pilgrims; and the Tartanes, and
other vessels, often touch there, that the
seamen may be provided with little pieces
of marble, which they earnestly request
may be taken as near the fissure as possible.
These they wear constantly in their pockets,
in case of shipwreck, from a persuasion,
that they are a more certain preservative
from drowning, than a cork jacket.
Some of these poor people have the misfortune
to be drowned, notwithstanding; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the sacred marble loses none of its reputation
on that account. Such accidents are
always imputed to the weight of the unfortunate
person’s sins, which have sunk him
to the bottom, in spite of all the efforts of
the marble to keep him above water; and
it is allowed on all hands, that a man so
oppressed with iniquity, as to be drowned
with a piece of this marble in his pocket,
would have sunk much sooner, if, instead
of that, he had had nothing to keep him
up but a cork jacket.</p>

<p>Strangers are next led to the Castle,
and are shewn, with some other curiosities,
the skeleton of the famous Bourbon, Constable
of France, who was killed in the
service of the emperor Charles the Fifth,
as he scaled the walls of Rome.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that France, a nation
which values itself so much on an affectionate
attachment to its princes, and places
loyalty at the head of the virtues, should
have produced, in the course of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
last centuries, so many illustrious rebels:
Bourbon, Coligni, Guise, Turenne, and
the Condés; all of them were, at some period
of their lives, in arms against their
sovereign.</p>

<p>That it is the duty of subjects to preserve
their allegiance, however unjustly
and tyrannically their prince may conduct
himself, is one of the most debasing and
absurd doctrines that ever was obtruded on
the understanding of mankind. When
Francis forgot the services which the gallant
Bourbon had rendered him at Mirignan;
when, by repeated acts of oppression,
he forgot the duty of a king; Bourbon
spurned at his allegiance, as a subject.
The Spanish nobleman, who declared that
he would pull down his house, if Bourbon
should be allowed to lodge in it, either
never had heard of the injurious treatment
which that gallant soldier had received, or
he betrayed the sentiments of a slave, and
meant to insinuate his own implicit loyalty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to the Emperor. Mankind in general have
a partiality for princes. The senses are
imposed on by the splendour which surrounds
them; and the respect due to the
office of a king, is naturally converted into
an affection for his person: there must
therefore be something highly unpopular
in the character of the monarch, and highly
oppressive in the measures of government,
before people can be excited to rebellion.
Subjects seldom rise through a desire
of attacking, but rather from an impatience
of suffering. Where men are
under the yoke of feudal lords, who can
force them to fight in any cause, it may be
otherwise; but when general discontent
pervades a free people, and when, in consequence
of this, they take arms against
their prince, they must have justice on
their side. The highest compliment which
subjects can pay, and the best service they
can render, to a good prince, is, to behave
in such a manner, as to convince him that
they would rebel against a bad one.</p>

<p>From Mola we were conducted by the
Appian way, over the fertile fields washed
by the silent Liris:</p>

<p class="noindent">This river bounded Latium. On its banks
are still seen some ruins of the ancient
Minturnæ. After Manlius Torquatus, in
what some will call a phrenzy of virtue,
had offered up his son as a sacrifice to military
discipline; and his colleague Decius,
immediately after, devoted himself in a
battle against the Latins; the broken army
of that people assembled at Minturnæ,
and were a second time defeated by Manlius,
and their lands divided by the senate
among the citizens of Rome. The first
battle was fought near Mount Vesuvius,
and the second between Sinuessa and Minturnæ.
In the morasses of Minturnæ,
Caius Marius, in the seventieth year of his
age, was taken, and brought a prisoner to
that city, whose magistrates ordered an assassin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
to put him to death, whom the fierce
veteran disarmed with a look. What
mortal, says Juvenal, would have been
thought more fortunate than Marius, had
he breathed out his aspiring soul, surrounded
by the captives he had made, his
victorious troops, and all the pomp of
war, as he descended from his Teutonic
chariot, after his triumph over the
Cimbri.</p>

<p>Several writers, in their remarks on
Italy, observe, that it was on the banks of
the Liris that Pyrrhus gained his dear-bought
victory over the Romans. They
have fallen into this mistake, by confounding
the Liris with the Siris, a river in
Magna Græcia, near Heraclea; in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
neighbourhood of which Pyrrhus defeated
the Romans by the means of his elephants.</p>

<p>Leaving Garilagno, which is the modern
name of the Liris, we pass the rising
ground where the ancient Sinuessa was
situated; the city where Horace met his
friends Plotius, Varius, and Virgil. The
friendly glow with which this admirable
painter has adorned their characters, conveys
an amiable idea of his own.</p>

<p>New Capua, through which the road
from Rome to Naples lies, is a small town
of no importance. The ancient city of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
name was situated two miles distant from
the new. The ruins of the amphitheatre,
which are still to be seen, give some idea
of the ancient grandeur of that city. Before
the amphitheatre of Vespasian was
built, there was none in Rome of equal
size with this. Old Capua is said, at one
period, to have vied in magnificence with
Rome and Carthage:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Altera dicta olim Carthago, atque altera Roma,</div>
<div class="verse">Nunc prostrata jacet, proprioque sepulta sepulchro.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The army of Hannibal is said to have
been conquered by the luxuries of this
place; but the judicious Montesquieu observes,
that the Carthaginian army, enriched
by so many victories, would have found
a Capua wherever they had gone. Whether
Capua brought on the ruin of
Hannibal or not, there can be no doubt
that Hannibal occasioned the ruin of
Capua.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Having broken their connection with
Rome, and formed an alliance with her
enemy, the Capuans were, in the course of
the war, besieged by the Consuls Fulvius
and Appius. Hannibal exerted all his vast
abilities for the relief of his new friends;
but was not able to bring the Roman army
to a battle, or to raise the siege. When
every other expedient had failed, he
marched directly to Rome, in the hopes of
drawing the Roman army after him to defend
the capital. A number of alarming
events conspired, at this time, to depress
the spirit of the Roman Senate. The Proconsul
Sempronius Gracchus, who commanded
an army in Lucania, had fallen
into an ambuscade, and was massacred.
The two gallant brothers, the Scipios, who
were their generals in Spain, had been defeated
and killed; and Hannibal was at their
gates. How did the Senate behave at this
crisis? Did they spend their time in idle
harangues and mutual accusations? Did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
they throw out reflections against those
senators who were against entering into a
treaty with the Carthaginians till their
army should be withdrawn from Italy?
Did they recall their army from Capua?
Did they shew any mark of despondence?
In this slate of affairs, the Roman Senate
sent orders to Appius to continue the siege
of Capua; they ordered a reinforcement to
their army in Spain; the troops for that
service marching out at one gate of Rome,
while Hannibal threatened to enter by
storm at another. How could such a people
fail to become the masters of the world!</p>

<p>The country between Capua and Naples
displays a varied scene of lavish fertility,
and with great propriety might be named
Campania Felix, if the richest and most generous
soil, with the mildest and most
agreeable climate, were sufficient to render
the inhabitants of a country happy.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LIV">LETTER LIV.</h2>

<p class="right">Naples.</p>

<p>The day after our arrival at this place,
we waited on Sir W—— H——,
his Majesty’s minister at this court. He had
gone early that morning on a hunting
party with the King; but the Portuguese
ambassador, at L——y H——’s desire, undertook
to accompany the D—— on the
usual round of visits; Sir W—— was
not expected to return for several days,
and the laws of etiquette do not allow
that important tour to be delayed so long.
As we have been continually driving
about ever since our arrival, I am already
pretty well acquainted with this
town, and the environs.</p>

<p>Naples was founded by the Greeks. The
charming situation they have chosen, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
one proof among thousands, of the fine
taste of that ingenious people.</p>

<p>The bay is about thirty miles in circumference,
and twelve in diameter; it has
been named Crater, from its supposed resemblance
to a bowl. This bowl is ornamented
with the most beautiful foliage,
with vines; with olive, mulberry, and
orange trees; with hills, dales, towns,
villas, and villages.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the bay of Naples, the
town is built in the form of a vast amphitheatre,
sloping from the hills towards the
sea.</p>

<p>If, from the town, you turn your eyes
to the east, you see the rich plains leading
to mount Vesuvius, and Portici. If you
look to the west, you have the Grotto of
Pausilippo, the mountain on which Virgil’s
tomb is placed, and the fields leading
to Puzzoli and the coast of Baia. On the
north, are the fertile hills, gradually rising
from the shore to the Campagna Felice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
On the South, is the bay, confined
by the two promontories of Misenum and
Minerva, the view being terminated by the
islands Procida, Ischia, and Caprea; and
as you ascend to the castle of St. Elmo,
you have all these objects under your eye
at once, with the addition of a great part
of the Campagna.</p>

<p>Independent of its happy situation,
Naples is a very beautiful city. The style
of architecture, it must be confessed, is inferior
to what prevails at Rome; but
though Naples cannot vie with that city
in the number of palaces, or in the grandeur
and magnificence of the churches,
the private houses in general are better built,
and are more uniformly convenient; the
streets are broader and better paved. No
street in Rome equals in beauty the Strada
di Toledo at Naples; and still less can any
of them be compared with those beautiful
streets which are open to the bay. This
is the native country of the Zephyrs; here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the excessive heat of the Sun is often
tempered with sea breezes, and with gales,
wafting the perfumes of the Campagna
Felice.</p>

<p>The houses, in general, are five or six
stories in height, and flat at the top; on
which are placed, numbers of flower vases
or fruit trees, in boxes of earth, producing
a very gay and agreeable effect.</p>

<p>The fortress of St. Elmo is built on a
mountain of the same name. The garrison
stationed here, have the entire command of
the town, and could lay it in ashes at
pleasure. A little lower, on the same
mountain, is a convent of Carthusians.
The situation of this convent is as advantageous
and beautiful as can be imagined;
and much expence has been lavished to
render the building, the apartments, and
the gardens, equal to the situation.</p>

<p>To bestow great sums of money in
adorning the retreat of men who have
abandoned the world for the express purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of passing the remainder of their
lives in self-denial and mortification, seems
to be very ill judged; and might, on some
occasions, counteract the design of their
retreat. I expressed this sentiment to a
Neapolitan lady at Sir W—— H——’s
assembly, the evening after I had visited
this convent. She said, “that the elegant
apartments, the gardens, and all the expensive
ornaments I had particularised,
could not much impede a system of self-denial;
for they soon became insipid to
those who had them constantly before their
eyes, and proved no compensation for the
want of other comforts.” “In that case,”
said I, “the whole expence might have
been saved, or bestowed in procuring
comforts to others who have made no
vows of mortification.” “Tolga iddio!”
cried the lady, forgetting her former
argument, “for none have so good a title
to every comfortable and pleasant thing
in this world, as those who have renounced
it, and placed their affections entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
on the next; instead of depriving
these sanctified Carthusians of what they
already possess, it would be more meritorious
to give them what they have
not.”</p>

<p>“Give them then, said I, what will afford
some satisfaction, instead of the luxuries
of sculpture, and paintings and architecture,
which, as you say, become so
soon insipid; let them have enjoyments
of a different kind. Why should their
diet be confined to fish and vegetables?
Let them enjoy the pleasures of the table
without any limitation. And since they
are so very meritorious, why is your sex
deprived of the happiness of their conversation,
and why are they denied the
pleasure which the society of women
might afford them?”</p>

<p>“Cristo benedetto!” cried the lady,
“You do not understand this matter.—Though
none deserve the pleasures of
this world, but those who think only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
on the next; yet none can obtain the
joys of the next, who indulge in the
pleasures of this.”</p>

<p>“That is unlucky,” said I.</p>

<p>“Unlucky! to be sure it is the most
unlucky thing that could have happened,
<i>ecco dove mi doleva</i>,” added the
lady.</p>

<p>Though Naples is admirably situated
for commerce, and no kingdom produces
the necessaries and luxuries of life in
greater profusion, yet trade is but in a
languishing condition; the best silks
come from Lyons, and the best woollen
goods from England.</p>

<p>The chief articles manufactured here, at
present, are, silk stockings, soap, snuff boxes
of tortoise shells, and of the lava of
Mount Vesuvius, tables, and ornamental
furniture, of marble.</p>

<p>They are thought to embroider here
better than even in France; and their macaroni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
is preferred to that made in any
other part of Italy. The Neapolitans excel
also in liqueurs and confections; particularly
in one kind of confection, which
is sold at a very high price, called Diabolonis.
This drug, as you will guess from
its name, is of a very hot and stimulating
nature, and what I should think by
no means requisite to Neapolitan constitutions.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of this town are computed
at three hundred and fifty thousand.
I make no doubt of their amounting to
that number; for though Naples is not
one third of the size of London, yet many
of the streets here are more crowded than
the Strand. In London and Paris, the
people who fill the streets are mere passengers,
hurrying from place to place on
business; and when they choose to converge,
or to amuse themselves, they resort
to the public walks or gardens: at Naples,
the citizens have fewer avocations of business
to excite their activity; no public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
walks, or gardens to which they can resort;
and are, therefore, more frequently seen
sauntering and conversing in the streets,
where a great proportion of the poorest
sort, for want of habitations, are obliged
to spend the night as well as the day.
While you sit in your chamber at London,
or at Paris, the usual noise you hear from
the streets, is that of carriages; but at
Naples, where they talk with uncommon
vivacity, and where whole streets full of
talkers are in continual employment the
noise of carriages is completely drowned
in the aggregated clack of human voices.
In the midst of all this idleness, fewer
riots or outrages of any kind happen,
than might be expected in a town where
the police is far from being strict, and
where such multitudes of poor unemployed
people meet together every day.
This partly proceeds from the national
character of the Italians; which, in my
opinion, is quiet, submissive, and averse
to riot or sedition; and partly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
common people being universally sober,
and never inflamed with strong and spirituous
liquors, as they are in the northern
countries. Iced water and lemonade
are among the luxuries of the lowest
vulgar; they are carried about in little barrels,
and sold in half-penny’s worth. The
half naked lazzarone is often tempted to
spend the small pittance destined for the
maintenance of his family, on this bewitching
beverage, as the most dissolute of the
low people in London spend their wages on
gin and brandy; so that the same extravagance
which cools the mob of the one city,
tends to inflame that of the other to acts
of excess and brutality.</p>

<p>There is not, perhaps, a city in the
world, with the same number of inhabitants,
in which so few contribute to the
wealth of the community by useful, or by
productive labour, as Naples; but the
numbers of priests, monks, fiddlers, lawyers,
nobility, footmen, and lazzaronis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
surpass all reasonable proportion; the last
alone are computed at thirty or forty
thousand. If these poor fellows are idle,
it is not their own fault; they are continually
running about the streets, as we are
told of the artificers of China; offering
their service, and begging for employment;
and are considered, by many, as of more
real utility than any of the classes above
mentioned.</p>

<p>There is an assembly once a week
at the house of the British minister;
no assembly in Naples is more numerous,
or more brilliant, than this. Exclusive
of that gentleman’s good qualities, and
those accomplishments which procure
esteem in any situation, he would meet
with every mark of regard from the Neapolitan
nobles, on account of the high
favour in which he stands with their Sovereign.
Sir W——’s house is open to
strangers of every country who come to
Naples properly recommended, as well as
to the English; he has a private concert
almost every evening. L——y H—— understands
music perfectly, and performs in
such a manner, as to command the admiration
even of the Neapolitans. Sir W——,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
who is the happiest tempered man in the
world, and the easiest amused, performs
also, and succeeds perfectly in amusing
himself, which is a more valuable attainment
than the other.</p>

<p>The Neapolitan nobility are excessively
fond of splendour and show. This appears
in the brilliancy of their equipages, the
number of their attendants, the richness
of their dress, and the grandeur of their
titles.</p>

<p>I am assured, that the King of Naples
counts a hundred persons with the title of
Prince, and still a greater number with
that of Duke, among his subjects. Six
or seven of these have estates, which produce
from ten to twelve or thirteen thousand
pounds a year; a considerable number
have fortunes of about half that value;
and the annual revenue of many is not
above one or two thousand pounds.
With respect to the inferior orders of nobility,
they are much poorer; many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Counts and Marquisses have not above
three or four hundred pounds a year of
paternal estate, many still less, and not a
few enjoy the title without any estate
whatever.</p>

<p>When we consider the magnificence of
their entertainments, the splendour of
their equipages, and the number of their
servants, we are surprised that the richest
of them can support such expensive establishments.
I dined, soon after our arrival,
at the Prince of Franca Villa’s; there were
about forty people at table; it was meagre
day; the dinner consisted entirely of fish
and vegetables, and was the most magnificent
entertainment I ever saw, comprehending
an infinite variety of dishes, a
vast profusion of fruit, and the wines of
every country in Europe. I dined since
at the Prince Iacci’s. I shall mention two
circumstances, from which you may form
an idea of the grandeur of an Italian
palace, and the number of domestics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
which some of the nobility retain. We
passed through twelve or thirteen large
rooms before we arrived at the dining
room; there were thirty-six persons at
table, none served but the Prince’s domestics,
and each guest had a footman
behind his chair; other domestics belonging
to the Prince remained in the adjacent
rooms, and in the hall. We afterwards
passed through a considerable number
of other rooms in our way to one
from which there is a very commanding
view.</p>

<p>No estate in England could support such
a number of servants, paid and fed as
English servants are; but here the wages
are very moderate indeed, and the greater
number of men servants, belonging to
the first families, give their attendance
through the day only, and find beds and
provisions for themselves. It must be remembered,
also, that few of the nobles
give entertainments, and those who do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
not, are said to live very sparingly; so
that the whole of their revenue, whatever
that may be, is exhausted on articles of
show.</p>

<p>As there is no Opera at present, the
people of fashion generally pass part of
the evening at the Corso, on the sea-shore.
This is the great scene of Neapolitan splendour
and parade; and, on grand occasions,
the magnificence displayed here will strike
a stranger very much. The finest carriages
are painted, gilt, varnished, and lined, in
a richer and more beautiful manner, than
has as yet become fashionable either in
England or France; they are often drawn
by six, and sometimes by eight horses. As
the last is the number allotted to his Britannic
Majesty when he goes to parliament,
some of our countrymen are offended
that any individuals whatsoever
should presume to drive with the same
number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the mode here, to have two running
footmen, very gaily dressed, before
the carriage, and three or four servants in
rich liveries behind; these attendants are
generally the handsomest young men that
can be procured. The ladies or gentlemen
within the coaches, glitter in all the brilliancy
of lace, embroidery, and jewels.
The Neapolitan carriages, for gala days,
are made on purpose, with very large
windows, that the spectators may enjoy a
full view of the parties within. Nothing
can be more showy than the harness of the
horses; their heads and manes are ornamented
with the rarest plumage, and their
tails set off with riband and artificial
flowers, in such a graceful manner that
you are apt to think they have been
adorned by the same hands that dressed the
heads of the ladies, and not by common
grooms.</p>

<p>After all, you will perhaps imagine the
amusement cannot be very great. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
carriages follow each other in two lines, moving
in opposite directions. The company
within smile, and bow, and wave the hand,
as they pass and repass their acquaintance;
and doubtless imagine, that they are the
most important figures in the procession.
The horses, however, seem to be quite of a
different way of thinking, and to consider
themselves as the chief objects of admiration,
looking on the livery servants, the
volantis, the lords, and the ladies, as their
natural suit on all such solemn occasions.</p>

<p class="right">Naples.</p>

<p>The greatest part of kings, whatever
may be thought of them after their
death, have the good fortune to be represented,
at some period of their lives, generally
at the beginning of their reigns, as
the greatest and most virtuous of mankind.
They are never compared to characters of
less dignity than Solomon, Alexander,
Cæsar, or Titus; and the comparison
usually concludes to the advantage of the
living monarch. They differ in this, as
in many other particulars, from those of
the most distinguished genius and exalted
merit among their subjects, That the fame
of the latter, if any awaits them, seldom
arrives at its meridian till many years after
their death; whereas the glory of the former
is at its fullest splendour during their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
lives; and most of them have the satisfaction
of hearing all their praises with their
own ears. Each particular monarch, taken
separately, is, or has been, considered as a
star of great lustre; yet any number of
them, taken without selection, and placed
in the historical galaxy, add little to its
brightness, and are often contemplated
with disgust. When we have occasion to
mention kings in general, the expression
certainly does not awaken a recollection of
the most amiable or most deserving part of
the human species; and tyranny in no country
is pushed so far, as to constrain men to speak
of them, when we speak in general terms, as
if they were. It would revolt the feelings,
and rouse the indignation, even of slaves.
Full freedom is allowed therefore on this
topic; and, under the most arbitrary government,
if you chuse to declaim on the
imbecility, profligacy, or corruption of
human nature, you may draw your illustrations
from the kings of any country,
provided you take them in groupes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
hint nothing to the detriment of the reigning
monarch. But, when we talk of any
one living sovereign, we should never allow
it to escape from our memory, that he
is wise, valiant, generous, and good; and
we ought always to have Solomon, Alexander,
Cæsar, and Titus, at our elbow, to
introduce them apropos when occasion offers.
We may have what opinion we
please of the whole race of Bourbon; but
it would be highly indecent to deny, that
the reigning kings of Spain and Naples
are very great princes. As I never had
the happiness of seeing the father, I can
only speak of the son. His Neapolitan
Majesty seems to be about the age of six or
seven-and-twenty. He is a prince of great
activity of body, and a good constitution;
he indulges in frequent relaxations from
the cares of government and the fatigue of
thinking, by hunting and other exercises;
and (which ought to give a high idea of
his natural talents) he never fails to acquire
a very considerable degree of perfection in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
those things to which he applies. He is
very fond, like the King of Prussia, of reviewing
his troops, and is perfectly master
of the whole mystery of the manual exercise.
I have had the honour, oftener than
once, of seeing him exercise the different
regiments which form the garrison here:
he always gave the word of command with
his own royal mouth, and with a precision
which seemed to astonish the whole Court.
This monarch is also a very excellent shot;
his uncommon success at this diversion is
thought to have roused the jealousy of his
Most Catholic Majesty, who also values
himself on his skill as a marksman. The
correspondence between those two great
personages often relates to their favourite
amusement.—A gentleman, who came lately
from Madrid, told me, that the King,
on some occasion, had read a letter which
he had just received from his son at Naples,
wherein he complained of his bad success
on a shooting party, having killed no more
than eighty birds in a day: and the Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
monarch, turning to his courtiers,
said, in a plaintive tone of voice, “Mio
filio piange di non aver’ fatto piu di ottante
beccacie in uno giorno, quando mi
crederei l’uomo il piu felice del mondo
se potesse fare quaranta.” All who take
a becoming share in the afflictions of a
royal bosom, will no doubt join with me,
in wishing better success to this good monarch,
for the future. Fortunate would it
be for mankind, if the happiness of their
princes could be purchased at so easy a
rate! and thrice fortunate for the generous
people of Spain, if the family connexions
of their monarch, often at variance with
the real interest of that country, should
never seduce him into a more ruinous war,
than that which he now wages against the
beasts of the field and the birds of the air.
His Neapolitan Majesty, as I am informed,
possesses many other accomplishments; I
particularise those only to which I have
myself been a witness. No king in Europe
is supposed to understand the game of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
billiards better. I had the pleasure of seeing
him strike the most brilliant stroke that
perhaps ever was struck by a crowned
head. The ball of his antagonist was near
one of the middle pockets, and his own in
such a situation, that it was absolutely necessary
to make it rebound from two different
parts of the cushion, before it could
pocket the other. A person of less enterprise
would have been contented with
placing himself in a safe situation, at a
small loss, and never have risqued any offensive
attempt against the enemy; but
the difficulty and danger, instead of intimidating,
seemed rather to animate the
ambition of this Prince. He summoned all
his address; he estimated, with a mathematical
eye, the angles at which the ball
must fly off; and he struck it with an undaunted
mind and a steady hand. It rebounded
obliquely, from the opposite side-cushion,
to that at the end; from which it
moved in a direct line towards the middle
pocket, which seemed to stand in gaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
expectation to receive it. The hearts of
the spectators beat thick as it rolled along;
and they shewed, by the contortions of
their faces and persons, how much they
feared that it should move one hair-breadth
in a wrong direction.—I must here interrupt
this important narrative, to observe,
that, when I talk of contortions, if you
form your idea from any thing of that kind
which you may have seen around an English
billiard-table or bowling-green, you
can have no just notion of those which
were exhibited on this occasion: your imagination
must triple the force and energy
of every English grimace, before it can do
justice to the nervous twist of an Italian
countenance.—At length the royal ball
reached that of the enemy, and with a
single blow drove it off the plain. An
universal shout of joy, triumph, and applause
burst from the beholders; but,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">the victorious ball, pursuing the enemy
too far, shared the same fate, and was
buried in the same grave, with the vanquished.
This fatal and unforeseen event
seemed to make a deep impression on the
minds of all who were witnesses to it; and
will no doubt be recorded in the annals of
the present reign, and quoted by future
poets and historians, as a striking instance
of the instability of sublunary felicity.</p>

<p>It is imagined that the cabinet of this
Court is entirely guided by that of
Spain; which, on its part, is thought to
be greatly under the influence of French
counsels. The manners, as well as the
politics, of France, are said to prevail at
present at the Court of Madrid. I do not
presume to say of what nature the politics
of his Neapolitan Majesty are, or whether
he is fond of French counsels or not; but
no true-born Englishman existing can shew
a more perfect contempt of their manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
than he does. In domestic life, this Prince
is generally allowed to be an easy master,
a good-natured husband, a dutiful son, and
an indulgent father.</p>

<p>The Queen of Naples is a beautiful woman,
and seems to possess the affability,
good-humour, and benevolence, which
distinguish, in such an amiable manner,
the Austrian family.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LVII">LETTER LVII.</h2>

<p class="right">Naples.</p>

<p>The hereditary jurisdiction of the
nobles over their vassals subsists,
both in the kingdom of Naples and Sicily,
in the full rigour of the feudal government.
The peasants therefore are poor; and it
depends entirely on the personal character
of the masters, whether their poverty is
not the least of their grievances. If the
land was leased out to free farmers, whose
property was perfectly secure, and the
leases of a sufficient length to allow the tenant
to reap the fruits of his own improvements,
there is no manner of doubt that
the estates of the nobility would produce
much more. The landlord might have a
higher rent paid in money, instead of being
collected in kind, which subjects him
to the salaries and impositions of a numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
train of stewards; and the tenants,
on their parts, would be enabled to live
much more comfortably, and to lay up,
every year, a small pittance for their families.
But the love of domineering is so
predominant in the breasts of men who
have been accustomed to it from their infancy,
that, if the alternative were in their
choice, many of them would rather submit
to be themselves slaves to the caprices of
an absolute prince, than become perfectly
independent, on the condition of giving
independence to their vassals. There is
reason to believe that this ungenerous spirit
prevails pretty universally among the
nobility all over Europe. The German
Barons are more shocked at the idea of
their peasants becoming perfectly free, like
the farmers of Great Britain, than they
are solicitous to limit the power of their
princes: And, from the sentiments I have
heard expressed by the French, I very
much doubt, whether their high nobility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
would accept of the privileges of English
peers, at the expence of that insolent superiority,
and those licentious freedoms,
with which <i>they</i> may, though no English
peer can, treat with impunity the citizens
and people of inferior rank. We need be
the less surprised at this, when we consider
that, in some parts of the British empire,
where the equable and generous laws of
England prevail, those who set the highest
value on freedom, who submit to every
hardship, and encounter every danger, to
secure it to themselves, never have shewn a
disposition of extending its blessings, or
even alleviating the bondage of that part
of the human species, which a sordid and
unjustifiable barter has brought into their
power.</p>

<p>The Court of Naples has not yet ventured,
by one open act of authority, to
abolish the immoderate power of the lords
over their tenants. But it is believed that
the Minister secretly wishes for its destruction;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and in cases of flagrant oppression,
when complaints are brought before the legal
courts, or directly to the King himself, by
the peasants against their lord, it is generally
remarked that the Minister favours
the complainant. Notwithstanding this,
the masters have so many opportunities of
oppressing, and such various methods of
teasing, their vassals, that they generally
chuse to bear their wrongs in silence; and
perceiving that those who hold their lands
immediately from the Crown, are in a
much easier situation than themselves;
without raising their hopes to perfect freedom,
the height of their wishes is to be
sheltered, from the vexations of little tyrants,
under the unlimited power of one
common master. The objects of royal attention,
they fondly imagine, are too sublime,
and the minds of kings too generous,
to stoop to, or even to countenance, in
their servants, the minute and unreasonable
exertions, which are wrung at present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
from the hard hands of the exhausted labourer.</p>

<p>Though the Neapolitan nobility still
retain the ancient feudal authority over the
peasants, yet their personal importance depends,
in a great measure, on the favour
of the King; who, under pretext of any
offence, can confine them to their own
estates, or imprison them at pleasure; and
who, without any alleged offence, and
without going to such extremes, can inflict
a punishment, highly sensible to them, by
not inviting them to the amusements of
the Court, or not receiving them with
smiles when they attend on any ordinary
occasion. Unless this Prince were so very
impolitic as to disgust all the nobility at
once, and so unite the whole body against
him, he has little to fear from their resentment.
Even in case of such an union,
as the nobles have lost the affection and attachment
of their peasants, what could they
do in opposition to a standing army of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
thirty thousand men, entirely devoted to
the Crown? The establishment of standing
armies has universally given stability to
the power of the prince, and ruined that
of the great lords. No nobility in Europe
can now be said to inherit political importance,
or to act independent of, or in opposition
to, the influence of the crown;
except the <i>temporal peers of that part of
Great Britain called England</i>.</p>

<p>As men of high birth are seldom, in
this country, called to the management of
public affairs, or placed in those situations
where great political knowledge is required;
and as his Majesty relies on his
own talents and experience in war for the
direction of the army; neither the civil
nor military establishments open any very
tempting field for the ambition of the nobles,
whose education is usually adapted to
the parts in life which they have a probability
of acting. Their fortunes and titles
descend to them, independent of any effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of their own. All the literary distinctions
are beneath their regard; it is therefore
not thought expedient to cloud the playful
innocence of their childhood, or the amiable
gaiety of their youth, with severe
study. In some other countries, where a
very small portion of literary education is
thought becoming for young men of rank,
and where even this small portion has been
neglected, they sometimes catch a little
knowledge of history and mythology, and
some useful moral sentiments, from the excellent
dramatic pieces that are represented
on their theatres. They also sometimes pick
up some notion of the different governments
in Europe, and a few political ideas,
in the course of their travels. But the nobility
of this country very seldom travel;
and the only dramatic pieces, represented
here, are operas; in which music, not sentiment,
is the principal thing attended to.
In the other theatrical entertainments,
Punchinello is the shining character. To
this disregard of literature among the nobles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
it is owing, that in their body are to
be found few tiresome, scholastic pedants,
and none of those perturbed spirits, who
ruffle the serenity of nations by political
alarms, who clog the wheels of government
by opposition, who pry into the conduct
of ministers, or in any way disturb
that total indifference with regard to the
public, which prevails all over this kingdom.
We are told by a great modern
Historian<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, that “force of mind, a sense
of personal dignity, gallantry in enterprise,
invincible perseverance in execution,
contempt of danger and of death,
are the characteristic virtues of uncivilised
nations.” But as the nobles of
this country have long been sufficiently civilised,
these qualities may in them be supposed
to have given place to the arts which
embellish a polished age; to gaming, gallantry,
music, the parade of equipage, the
refinements of dress, and other nameless
refinements.</p>

<p class="right">Naples.</p>

<p>The citizens of Naples form a society
of their own, perfectly distinct from
the nobility; and although they are not
the most industrious people in the world,
yet, having some degree of occupation,
and their time being divided between business
and pleasure, they probably have
more enjoyment than those, who, without
internal resources, or opportunities of
active exertion, pass their lives in sensual
gratifications, and in waiting the returns
of appetite around a gaming table. In
the most respectable class of citizens, are
comprehended the lawyers, of whom
there are an incredible number in this
town. The most eminent of this profession
hold, indeed, a kind of intermediate
rank between the nobility and citizens;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the rest are on a level with the physicians,
the principal merchants, and the artists;
none of whom can make great fortunes,
however industrious they may be; but a
moderate income enables them to support
their rank in society, and to enjoy all the
conveniences, and many of the luxuries, of
life.</p>

<p>England is perhaps the only nation in
Europe where some individuals, of every
profession, even of the lowest, find it
possible to accumulate great fortunes; the
effect of this very frequently is, that the
son despises the profession of the father,
commences gentleman, and dissipates, in
a few years, what cost a life to gather.
In the principal cities of Germany and
Italy, we find, that the ancestors of many
of those citizens who are the most eminent
in their particular businesses, have transmitted
the art to them through several
generations. It is natural to imagine,
that this will tend to the improvement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the art, or science, or profession, as well
as the family fortune; and that the third
generation will acquire knowledge from
the experience, as well as wealth from
the industry, of the former two; whereas,
in the cases alluded to above, the wheel of
fortune moves differently. A man, by
assiduity in a particular business, and by
genius, acquires a great fortune and a high
reputation; the son throws away the fortune,
and ruins his own character by extravagance;
and the grandson is obliged
to recommence the business, unaided by
the wealth or experience of his ancestors.
This, however, is pointing out an evil
which I should be sorry to see remedied;
because it certainly originates in the riches
and prosperity of the country in which it
exists.</p>

<p>The number of priests, monks, and ecclesiastics
of all the various orders that
swarm in this city, is prodigious; and the
provision appropriated for their use, is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
ample, I am assured, that the clergy are
in possession of considerably above one-third
of the revenue of the whole kingdom,
over and above what some particular
orders among them acquire by begging
for the use of their convents, and what
is gotten in legacies by the address and
assiduity of the whole. The unproductive
wealth, which is lodged in the churches
and convents of this city, amounts also to
an amazing value. Not to be compared in
point of architecture to the churches and
convents of Rome, those of Naples surpass
them in riches, in the value of their
jewels, and in the quantity of silver and
golden crucifixes, vessels, and implements
of various kinds. I have often heard
these estimated at a sum so enormous as
to surpass all credibility; and which, as I
have no opportunity of ascertaining with
any degree of precision, I shall not mention.
This wealth, whatever it amounts
to, is of as little use to the kingdom, as
if it still remained in the mines of Peru;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
and the greater part of it, surely, affords
as little comfort to the clergy and monks
as to any other part of the community;
for though it belongs to their church, or
their convent, yet it can no more be converted
to the use of the priests and monks
of such churches and convents, than to the
tradesmen who inhabit the adjacent streets.
For this reason I am a good deal surprised,
that no pretext, or subterfuge, has been
found, no expedient fallen on, no treaty or
convention made, for appropriating part of
this at least, to the use of some set of
people or other. If the clergy were to
lay their hands on it, this might be found
fault with by the King; if his Majesty
dreamt of taking any part of it for the
exigencies of the state, the clergy would
undoubtedly raise a clamour; and if both
united, the Pope would think he had a
right to pronounce his veto; but if all
these three powers could come to an understanding,
and settle their proportions, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
am apt to think a partition might be made
as quietly as that of Poland.</p>

<p>Whatever scruples the Neapolitan clergy
may have to such a project, they certainly
have none to the full enjoyment of
their revenues. No class of men can be
less disposed to offend Providence by a
peevish neglect of the good things which
the bounty of heaven has bestowed. Self-denial
is a virtue, which I will not say
they possess in a smaller degree, but which,
I am sure, they affect less than any other
ecclesiastics I know; they live very much
in society, both with the nobles and citizens.
All of them, the monks not excepted,
attend the theatre, and seem to
join most cordially in other diversions
and amusements; the common people are
no ways offended at this, or imagine that
they ought to live in a more recluse manner.
Some of the orders have had the
address to make a concern for their temporal
interest, and a desire of seeing them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
live full, and in something of a jolly manner,
be regarded by the common people
as a proof of zeal for religion. I am informed,
that a very considerable diminution
in the number of monks has taken
place in the kingdom of Naples since the
suppression of the Jesuits, and since a
liberty of quitting the cowl was granted
by the late Pope; but still there is no
reason to complain of a deficiency in this
order of men. The richest and most
commodious convents in Europe, both for
male and female votaries, are in this city;
the most fertile and beautiful hills of the
environs are covered with them; a small
part of their revenue is spent in feeding
the poor, the monks distributing bread and
soup to a certain number every day before
the doors of the convents. Some of the
friars study physic and surgery, and
practise these arts with great applause.
Each convent has an apothecary’s shop belonging
to it, where medicines are delivered
gratis to the poor, and sold to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
who can afford to pay. On all these accounts
the monks in general are greater
favourites with the common people than
even the secular clergy; all the charity of
the friars, however, would not be able to
cover their sins, if the stories circulated
by their enemies were true,—by which
they are represented as the greatest profligates
and debauchees in the world. Without
giving credit to all that is reported on
this subject, as the Neapolitan monks are
very well fed, as this climate is not the
most favourable to continency (a virtue
which in this place is by no means estimated
in proportion to its rarity), it is
most likely that the inhabitants of the
convents, like the inhabitants in general,
indulge in certain pleasures with less
scruple or restraint than is usual in some
other places. Be that as it may, it is certain
that they are the most superstitious of
mankind; a turn of mind which they
communicate with equal zeal and success
to a people remarkably ignorant, and remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
amorous. The seeds of superstition
thus zealously sown on such a warm
and fertile, though uncultivated, soil,
sometimes produce the most extraordinary
crops of sensuality and devotion that ever
were seen in any country.</p>

<p>The lazzaroni, or black-guards, as has
been already observed, form a considerable
part of the inhabitants of Naples;
and have, on some well-known occasions,
had the government for a short
time in their own hands. They are computed
at above thirty thousand; the
greater part of them have no dwelling-houses,
but sleep every night under porticos,
piazzas, or any kind of shelter they
can find. Those of them who have wives
and children, live in the suburbs of Naples
near Pausilippo, in huts, or in caverns
or chambers dug out of that
mountain. Some gain a livelihood by
fishing, others by carrying burdens to and
from the shipping; many walk about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
streets ready to run on errands, or to perform
any labour in their power for a very
small recompence. As they do not meet
with constant employment, their wages
are not sufficient for their maintenance; the
soup and bread distributed at the door of the
convents supply the deficiency. The lazzaroni
are generally represented as a lazy, licentious,
and turbulent set of people;
what I have observed gives me a very different
idea of their character. Their idleness
is evidently the effect of necessity,
not of choice; they are always ready to
perform any work, however laborious, for
a very reasonable gratification. It must
proceed from the fault of Government,
when such a number of stout active citizens
remain unemployed; and so far are
they from being licentious and turbulent,
that I cannot help thinking they are by
much too tame and submissive. Though
the inhabitants of the Italian cities were
the first who shook off the feudal yoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and though in Naples they have long enjoyed
the privilege of municipal jurisdiction,
yet the external splendour of the
nobles, and the authority they still exercise
over the peasants, impose upon the
minds of the lazzaroni; and however
bold and resentful they may be of injuries
offered by others, they bear the insolence
of the nobility as passively as peasants
fixed to the soil. A coxcomb of a volanti
tricked out in his fantastical dress, or any
of the liveried slaves of the great, make
no ceremony of treating these poor fellows
with all the insolence and insensibility natural
to their matters; and for no visible
reason, but because he is dressed in lace,
and the others in rags. Instead of calling
to them to make way, when the noise in
the streets prevents the common people
from hearing the approach of the carriage,
a stroke across the shoulders with
the cane of the running footman, is the
usual warning they receive. Nothing
animates this people to insurrection, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
some very pressing and very universal cause;
such as a scarcity of bread: every other grievance
they bear as if it were their charter.
When we consider thirty thousand human
creatures without beds or habitations,
wandering almost naked in search of food
through the streets of a well built city;
when we think of the opportunities they
have of being together, of comparing
their own destitute situation with the affluence
of others, one cannot help being
astonished at their patience.</p>

<p>Let the prince be distinguished by splendour
and magnificence; let the great and
the rich have their luxuries; but, in the
name of humanity, let the poor, who
are willing to labour, have food in abundance
to satisfy the cravings of nature,
and raiment to defend them from the inclemencies
of the weather!</p>

<p>If their governors, whether from weakness
or neglect, do not supply them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
these, they certainly have a right to help
themselves.—Every law of equity and
common sense will justify them, in revolting
against such governors, and in satisfying
their own wants from the superfluities
of lazy luxury.</p>

<p>I have made several visits to the museum
at Portici, principally, as you
may believe, to view the antiquities dug
out of Herculaneum and Pompeia. The
work publishing by Government, ornamented
with engravings of the chief articles
of this curious collection, will, in
all probability, be continued for many
years, as new articles worthy of the
sculptor’s art are daily discovered, and as
a vast mine of curiosities is supposed to
be concealed in the unopened streets
of Pompeia. Among the ancient paintings,
those which ornamented the theatre
of Herculaneum are more elegant
than any that have hitherto been found
at Pompeia. All those paintings were
executed upon the stucco which lined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
walls; they have been sawed off with
great labour and address, and are now
preserved in glass cases; the colours, we
are told, were much brighter before they
were drawn out of their subterraneous
abode, and exposed to the open air; they
are, however, still wonderfully lively:
the subjects are understood at the first
glance by those who are acquainted with
the Grecian history and mythology. There
is a Chiron teaching Achilles to play on
the lyre, Ariadne deserted, the Judgment
of Paris, some Bacchantes and Fauns; the
largest piece represents Theseus’s victory
over the Minotaur. It consists of seven or
eight figures very well grouped, but a
Frieze, with a dancing woman, on a black
ground, not above ten inches long, is
thought the best.</p>

<p>We ought not, however, to judge of
the progress which the ancients had made
in the art of painting, by the degree of
perfection which appears in those pictures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
It is not probable that the best paintings of
ancient Greece or Italy were at Herculaneum;
and, if it could be ascertained that
some of the productions of the best matters
were there, it would not follow that those
which have been discovered are of that
class. If a stranger were to enter at random
a few houses in London, and see some
tolerably good pictures there, he could not
with propriety conclude that the best of
them were the very best in London. The
paintings brought from Herculaneum are
perfect proofs that the ancients had made
that progress in the art, which those pictures
indicate; but do not form even a
presumption, that they had not made a
much greater. It is almost demonstrable
that these paintings are not of their best.
The same school which formed the sculptor
to correctness, would form the painter
to equal correctness in his drawings, however
deficient he might be in all the other
parts of his art. Their best statues are
correct in their proportions, and elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
in their forms: These paintings are not
correct in their proportions, and are comparatively
inelegant in their forms.</p>

<p>Among the statues, the drunken Faun
and the Mercury are the best. There are
some fine bronze busts; the intaglios and
cameos, which hitherto have been found
either in Herculaneum or Pompeia, are
reckoned but indifferent.</p>

<p>The elegance of form, with the admirable
workmanship, of the ornamental furniture
and domestic utensils, in silver and
other metals; the variety and beauty of
the lamps, tripods, and vases; sufficiently
testify, if there were no other proofs, the
fertile imagination and exquisite execution
of the ancient artists. And, had their
own poets and historians been quite silent
concerning the Roman refinements in the
art of cookery, and the luxury of their
tables; the prodigious variety of culinary
instruments, the moulds for jellies, for
confections, and pastry, which are collected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
in this museum, would afford a strong
presumption that the great men of our
own days have a nearer resemblance to
those ancient conquerors of the world,
than is generally imagined.</p>

<p>Many of the ancient manuscripts found
at Herculaneum have been carried to
Madrid; but a great number still remain
at Portici. Great pains have been bestowed,
and much ingenuity displayed, in separating
and unrolling the sheets, without
destroying the writing. This has succeeded
in a certain degree; though, in spite of
all the skill and attention of those who are
employed in this very delicate work, the
copiers are obliged to leave many blanks
where the letters are obliterated. The
manuscripts hitherto unrolled and copied,
are in the Greek language, and not of a
very important nature. As the unrolling
those papers must take up a great deal of
time, and requires infinite address, it is to
be wished that his Neapolitan Majesty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
would send one at least to every university
in Europe, that the abilities of the most
ingenious men of every country might be
exercised on a subject so universally interesting.
The method which should be
found to succeed best, might be immediately
made known, and applied to the unfolding
of the remaining manuscripts. The
probability of recovering those works,
whose loss the learned have so long lamented,
would by this means be greatly
increased.</p>

<p>Herculaneum and Pompeia were destroyed
by the same eruption of Mount
Vesuvius, about seventeen hundred years
ago. The former was a town of much
more magnificence than the other; but it
is infinitely more difficult to be cleared of
the matter which covers it. Sir William
Hamilton, in his accurate and judicious
observations on Mount Vesuvius, asserts,
that there are evident marks that the matter
of six eruptions has taken its course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
over this devoted town, since the great explosion
which involved it in the same fate
with Pompeia. These different eruptions
have all happened at considerable distances
of time from each other. This appears by
the layers of good soil which are found
between them. But the matter which immediately
covers the town, and with
which the theatre, and all the houses hitherto
examined, were found filled, is not
lava, but a sort of soft stone, composed of
pumice and ashes, intermixed with earth.
This has saved the pictures, manuscripts,
busts, utensils, and other antiquities,
which have been recovered out
of Herculaneum, from utter destruction.
For if any of the six succeeding
eruptions had happened previous to this,
and the red-hot liquid lava, of which they
consisted, had flowed into the open city, it
would have filled every street, scorched up
every combustible substance with intense
heat, involving the houses, and all they
contained, in one solid rock of lava,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
undistinguishable, and for ever inseparable,
from it. The eruption, which buried the
city in cinders, earth, and ashes, has in
some measure preserved it from the more
destructive effects of the fiery torrents which
have overwhelmed it since.</p>

<p>When we consider that the intervals between
those eruptions were sufficiently
long to allow a soil to be formed upon the
hardened lava of each; that a new city
has been actually built on the lava of the
last eruption; and that the ancient city is
from seventy to one hundred feet below
the present surface of the earth; we must
acknowledge it more surprising that any,
than that so few, of its ornaments have
been recovered. At the beginning of the
present century, any body would have imagined
that the busts, statues and pictures
of Herculaneum had not a much better
chance, than the persons they represent,
of appearing again, within a few years,
upon the surface of this globe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>The case is different with regard to
Pompeia. Though it was not discovered
till about twenty-five years ago, which is
forty years almost after the discovery of
Herculaneum, yet the probability was
greatly in favour of its being discovered
sooner, for Pompeia has felt the effects of
a single eruption only; it is not buried
above twelve feet below the surface of
the ground, and the earth, ashes, cinders,
and pumice-stones, with which it is covered,
are so light, and so little tenacious,
that they might be removed with no great
difficulty. If the attention of his Neapolitan
Majesty were not engrossed with
more important concerns, he might have
the whole town uncovered in a very short
space of time; half the lazzaroni of Naples
could complete the business in
one year. Hitherto only one street and
a few detached buildings are cleared; the
street is well paved with the same kind
of stone of which the ancient roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
are made, narrow causeways are raised a
foot and an half on each side for the conveniency
of foot passengers. The street
itself, to my recollection, is not so broad
as the narrowest part of the Strand, and
is supposed to have been inhabited by
tradespeople. The traces of wheels of
carriages are to be seen on the pavement;
the distance between the traces is less than
that between the wheels of a modern post-chaise.
I remarked this the more as, on
my first viewing the street, I doubted whether
there was room for two modern
coaches to pass each other. I plainly saw
there was sufficient room for two of the
ancient chariots, whose wheels were of no
greater distance than between the traces on
the pavement. The houses are small, and
in a very different style from the modern
Italian houses; for the former give an
idea of neatness and conveniency. The
stucco on the walls is hard as marble,
smooth and beautiful. Some of the rooms
are ornamented with paintings, mostly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
single figures, representing some animal;
they are tolerably well executed, and on
a little water being thrown on them, the
colours appear surprisingly fresh.</p>

<p>Most of the houses are built on the
same plan, and have one small room from
the passage, which is conjectured to have
been the shop, with a window to the
street, and a place which seems to have
been contrived for shewing the goods to
the greatest advantage. The nature of
the traffic carried on at one particular
house, is indicated by a figure in alto
relievo of a very expressive kind, immediately
above the door.</p>

<p>It is to be wished they would cover one
of the best houses with a roof, as nearly
resembling that which originally belonged
to it as they could imagine, with a complete
assortment of the antique furniture
of the kitchen and each particular room.
Such a house fitted up with accuracy and
judgment, with all its utensils and ornaments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
properly arranged, would be an
object of universal curiosity, and would
swell the heart of the antiquarian with veneration
and delight. Only imagine, my
dear Sir, what those gentlemen must feel,
when they see the venerable habitations of
the ancients in their present mournful
condition, neglected, despised, abandoned
to the peltings of rain, and all the injuries
of the weather! those precious
walls, which, were it possible to transport
them to the various countries of the
world, would be bought with avidity, and
placed in the gardens of Princes! How
must the bosoms of all true virtuosos glow
with indignation, when they behold the
mansions of the ancient Romans stripped of
their ornaments, dishonoured, and exposed,
like a parcel of ragged galley slaves, in
the most indecent manner, with hardly
any covering to their nakedness; while
a little paltry brick house, coming the
Lord knows how, from a country which
men of taste have always despised, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
been received with hospitality, dressed in
a fine coat of the richest marble, adorned
with jewels and precious stones,
and treated with every mark of honourable
distinction!</p>

<p>In another part of the town of Pompeia,
there is a rectangular building, with a
colonade, towards the court, something in
the style of the Royal Exchange at London,
but smaller. This has every appearance of a
barrack and guard room; the pillars are
of brick, covered with shining stucco, elegantly
fluted; the scrawlings and drawings
still visible on the walls, are such as we
might naturally expect on the walls of a
guard room, where soldiers are the designers,
and swords the engraving tools.
They consist of gladiators fighting, some
with each other, some with wild beasts;
the games of the circus, as chariot races,
wrestling, and the like; a few figures in
caricatura, designed probably by some of
the soldiers, in ridicule of their companions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
or perhaps of their officers; and there
are abundance of names inscribed on various
parts of the wall, according to the
universal custom of the humblest candidates
for fame in all ages and countries.
It may be safely asserted, that none of
those who have endeavoured to transmit
their names to posterity in this manner,
have succeeded so well as the soldiers of
the garrison of Pompeia.</p>

<p>At a considerable distance from the barrack,
is a building, known by the inscription
upon it, for a temple of the goddess
Isis; there is nothing very magnificent in
its appearance; the pillars are of brick stuccoed
like those of the guard room. The
best paintings, hitherto found at Pompeia,
are those of this temple; they have been
cut out of the walls and removed to
Portici. It was absolutely necessary to do
this with the pictures at Herculaneum, because
<i>there</i> they could not be seen without
the help of torches; but <i>here</i>, where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
could be seen by the light of the Sun, they
would, in my humble opinion, have appeared
to more advantage, and have had
a better effect in the identical situation in
which they were placed by the ancient
artist. A few still remain, particularly
one, which is considered by travellers as a
great curiosity; it is a small view of a
villa, with the gardens belonging to it.</p>

<p>There is one house or villa without the
walls, on a much larger scale than any of
the others. In a large cellar, or vaulted
gallery, belonging to this house, there are
a number of amphoræ, or earthen vessels,
arranged along the walls; most of them
filled with a kind of red substance,
supposed to have been wine. This cellar
is sunk about two-thirds below the surface
of the ground, and is lighted by
small narrow windows. I have called it
gallery, because it is about twelve feet in
width, and is the whole length of two
adjoining sides of the square which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
villa forms. It was used not only as a repository
for wine, but also as a cool retreat
for the family during excessive hot
weather. Some of this unfortunate family
sought shelter in this place from
the destructive shower which overwhelmed
the town. Eight skeletons, four being
those of children, were found here; where
they must have met a more cruel and
lingering death, than that which they
shunned. In one room, the body of a man
was found; with an ax in the hand; it is
probable he had been endeavouring to
cut a passage into the open air; he had
broken and pierced the wall, but had expired
before he could clear away the surrounding
rubbish. Few skeletons were
found in the streets, but a considerable
number in the houses. Before the decisive
shower fell, which smothered the inhabitants
of this ill fated city, perhaps
such quantities of ashes and cinders were
occasionally falling, as frightened, and
obliged them to keep within doors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>It is impossible to view those skeletons,
and reflect on this dreadful catastrophe,
without horror and compassion. We cannot
think of the inhabitants of a whole
town being destroyed at once, without
imagining that their fate has been uncommonly
severe. But are not the inhabitants
of all the towns then existing, of
whom we think without any emotion of
pity, as completely dead as those of Pompeia?
And could we take them one by
one, and consider the nature of their
deaths, and the circumstances attending
that of each individual; some destroyed
by painful bodily diseases, some by the
torture of the executioner, some bowed to
the grave by the weight of accumulated
sorrow, and the slow anguish of a broken
heart, after having suffered the pangs of
dissolution, over and over again, in the
death of those they loved, after having
beheld the dying agonies of their children;
could all this, I say, be appraised,
calculated, and compared, the balance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
suffering might not be found with the inhabitants
of Pompeia, but rather with
those of the contemporary cities, who,
perhaps at that time, as we do now, lamented
its severe fate.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LX">LETTER LX.</h2>

<p class="right">Naples.</p>

<p>As I sauntered along the Strada Nuova
lately, I perceived a groupe of people
listening, with much attention, to a
person who harangued them in a raised,
solemn voice, and with great gesticulation.
I immediately made one of the auditory,
which increased every moment; men, women,
and children bringing seats from the
neighbouring houses, on which they placed
themselves around the orator. He repeated
stanzas from Ariosto, in a pompous, recitativo
cadence, peculiar to the natives of
Italy; and he had a book in his hand, to
assist his memory when it failed. He
made occasional commentaries in prose, by
way of bringing the Poet’s expression nearer
to the level of his hearers’ capacities.
His cloak hung loose from one shoulder;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
his right arm was disengaged, for the purposes
of oratory. Sometimes he waved it
with a slow, smooth motion, which accorded
with the cadence of the verses;
sometimes he pressed it to his breast, to
give energy to the pathetic sentiments of
the Poet. Now he gathered the hanging
folds of the right side of his cloak, and
held them gracefully up, in imitation of a
Roman senator; and anon he swung them
across his left shoulder, like a citizen of
Naples. He humoured the stanza by his
voice, which he could modulate to the key
of any passion, from the boisterous bursts
of rage, to the soft notes of pity or love.
But, when he came to describe the exploits
of Orlando, he trusted neither to the powers
of his own voice, nor the Poet’s genius;
but, throwing off his cloak, and
grasping his cane, he assumed the warlike
attitude and stern countenance of that hero;
representing, by the most animated
action, how he drove his spear through the
bodies of six of his enemies at once; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
point at the same time killing a seventh,
who would also have remained transfixed
with his companions, if the spear could
have held more than six men of an ordinary
size upon it at a time.</p>

<p class="noindent">I must however do this audience the justice
to acknowledge, that they seemed to feel
the pathetic and sublime, as well as the
ludicrous, parts of the ancient Bard.</p>

<p>This practice of rehearsing the verses of
Ariosto, Tasso, and other poets, in the
street, I have not observed in any other
town of Italy; and I am told it is less
common here than it was formerly. I remember
indeed, at Venice, to have frequently
seen mountebanks, who gained
their livelihood by amusing the populace
at St. Mark’s Place, with wonderful and
romantic stories in prose.—“Listen, Gentlemen,”
said one of them; “let
me crave your attention, ye beautiful
and virtuous ladies; I have something
equally affecting and wonderful
to tell you; a strange and stupendous
adventure, which happened to a gallant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
knight.”—Perceiving that this did not
sufficiently interest the hearers, he exalted
his voice, calling out that his Knight was
uno Cavalliero Cristiano. The audience
seemed still a little fluctuating. He raised
his voice a note higher, telling them that
this Christian Knight was one of their own
victorious countrymen, “un’ Eroe Veneziano.”
This fixed them; and he proceeded
to relate how the Knight, going to
join the Christian army, which was on its
march to recover the Sepulchre of Christ
from the hands of the Infidels, lost his
way in a vast wood, and wandered at
length to a castle, in which a lady of transcendent
beauty was kept prisoner by a gigantic
Saracen, who, having failed in all
his endeavours to gain the heart of this
peerless damsel, resolved to gratify his passion
by force; and had actually begun the
horrid attempt, when the shrieks of this
chaste maiden reached the ears of the Venetian
hero; who, ever ready to relieve
virgins in distress, rushed into the apartment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
from whence the cries issued. The
brutal ravisher, alarmed at the noise, quits
the struggling lady, at the very instant
when her strength began to fail; draws
his flaming sword; and a dreadful combat
begins between him and the Christian
Knight, who performs miracles of courage
and address in resisting the blows of this
mighty giant; till, his foot unfortunately
slipping in the blood which flowed on the
pavement, he fell at the feet of the Saracen;
who, immediately seizing the advantage
which chance gave him, raised his
sword with all his might, and—Here
the orator’s hat flew to the ground, open
to receive the contributions of the listeners;
and he continued repeating, “raised
his sword over the head of the Christian
Knight”—“raised his bloody, murderous
brand, to destroy your noble, valiant
countryman.”—But he proceeded
no farther in his narrative, till all who
seemed interested in it had thrown something
into the hat. He then pocketed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
money with great gravity, and went on to
inform them, that, at this critical moment,
the Lady, seeing the danger which threatened
her deliverer, redoubled her prayers
to the Blessed Mary, who, a virgin herself,
is peculiarly attentive and propitious to
the prayers of virgins. Just as the Saracen’s
sword was descending on the head of
the Venetian, a large bee flew, quick as
thought, in at the window, stung the former
very smartly on the left temple, diverted
the blow, and gave the Christian
Knight time to recover himself. The fight
then recommenced with fresh fury; but,
after the Virgin Mary had taken such a
decided part, you may believe it was no
match. The Infidel soon fell dead at the
feet of the Believer. But who do you
think this beauteous maiden was, on whose
account the combat had begun? Why no
other than the sister of the Venetian Hero.—This
young lady had been stolen from
her father’s house, while she was yet a
child, by an Armenian merchant, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
dealt in no other goods than women. He
concealed the child till he found means to
carry her to Egypt; where he kept her
in bondage, with other young girls, till
the age of fifteen, and then sold her to
the Saracen. I do not exactly remember
whether the recognition between the brother
and sister was made out by means of
a mole on the young lady’s neck, or by a
bracelet on her arm, which, with some
other of her mother’s jewels, happened to
be in her pocket when she was stolen;
but, in whatever manner this came about,
there was the greatest joy on the happy
occasion; and the lady joined the army
with her brother, and one of the Christian
commanders fell in love with her, and
their nuptials were solemnized at Jerusalem;
and they returned to Venice, and
had a very numerous family of the finest
children you ever beheld.</p>

<p>At Rome, those street-orators sometimes
entertain their audience with interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
passages of real history. I remember having
heard one, in particular, give a full
and true account how the bloody heathen
emperor Nero set fire to the city of Rome,
and sat at a window of his golden palace,
playing on a harp, while the town was in
flames. After which the Historian proceeded
to relate, how this unnatural emperor
murdered his own mother; and he
concluded by giving the audience the satisfaction
of hearing a particular detail of all
the ignominious circumstances attending
the murderer’s own death.</p>

<p>This business of street-oratory, while it
amuses the populace, and keeps them from
less innocent and more expensive pastimes,
gives them at the same time some general
ideas of history. Street-orators, therefore,
are a more useful set of men than another
class, of which there are numbers at
Rome, who entertain companies with extemporaneous
verses on any given subject.
The last are called Improuvisatoris; and some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
people admire these performances greatly.
For my own part, I am too poor a judge
of the Italian language either to admire or
condemn them; but, from the nature of
the thing, I should imagine they are but
indifferent. It is said, that the Italian
is peculiarly calculated for poetry, and
that verses may be made with more facility
in this than in any other language. It
may be more easy to find smooth lines,
and make them terminate in rhime in
Italian, than in any language; but to
compose verses with all the qualities essential
to good poetry, I imagine leisure
and long reflection are requisite. Indeed
I understand, from those who are judges,
that those extempore compositions of the
Improuvisatori are in general but mean
productions, consisting of a few fulsome
compliments to the company, and some
common-place observations, put into rhime,
on the subject proposed. There is, however,
a lady of an amiable character, Signora
Corilla, whose extempore productions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
which she repeats in the most graceful
manner, are admired by people of real
taste. While we were at Rome, this lady
made an appearance one evening, at the
assembly of the Arcadi, which charmed a
very numerous company; and of which our
friend Mr. R—y has given me such an account,
as makes me regret that I was not present.
After much entreaty, a subject being
given, she began, accompanied by two violins,
and sung her unpremeditated strains with
great variety of thought and elegance of
language. The whole of her performance
lasted above an hour, with three or four
pauses, of about five minutes each, which
seemed necessary, more that she might recover
her strength and voice, than for recollection;
for that gentleman said, that
nothing could have more the air of
inspiration, or what we are told of the
Pythian Prophetess. At her first setting
out, her manner was sedate, or rather
cold; but gradually becoming animated,
her voice rose, her eyes sparkled, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
rapidity and beauty of her expressions and
ideas seemed supernatural. She at last
called on another member of the society to
sing alternately with her, which he complied
with; but Mr. R——y thought,
though they were <i>Arcades ambo</i>, they were
by no means <i>cantare pares</i>.</p>

<p>Naples is celebrated for the finest opera
in Europe. This however happens not to
be the season of performing; but the
common people enjoy <i>their</i> operas at all
seasons. Little concerts of vocal and instrumental
music are heard every evening
in the Strada Nuova, the Chiaca, the
Strada di Toledo, and other streets; and
young men and women are seen dancing
to the music of ambulatory performers all
along this delightful bay. To a mere
spectator, the amusements of the common
people afford more delight, than those of
the great; because they seem to be more
enjoyed by the one class, than by the other.
This is the case every where, except in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
France; where the high appear as happy as
those of middle rank, and the rich are very
near as merry as the poor. But, in most
other countries, the people of great rank and
fortune, though they flock to every kind
of entertainment, from not knowing what
to do with themselves, yet seem to enjoy
them less than those of inferior rank and
fortune.</p>

<p>The English particularly are said to be
in this predicament. This may be true in
some degree; though I imagine there is
more appearance than reality in it; owing
to an absurd affectation of indifference, or
what the French call <i>nonchalance</i>, which has
prevailed of late years. A few insipid
characters in high life, whose internal
vacancy leads them to seek amusement in
public places, and whose insensibility prevents
them from finding it, have probably
brought this appearance of a want of all
enjoyment into fashion. Those who wish
to be thought of what is called the <i>ton</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
imitate the mawkish insipidity of their superiors
in rank, and imagine it distinguishes
them from the vulgar, to suppress
all the natural expressions of pity, joy, or
admiration, and to seem, upon all occasions,
in a state of complete apathy.
Those amiable creatures frequent public
places, that it may be said of them, <i>They
are not as other men are</i>. You will see
them occasionally at the playhouse, placed
in the boxes, like so many busts, with unchanging
features; and, while the rest of
the audience yield to the emotions excited
by the poet and the actors, those men of
the <i>ton</i> preserve the most dignified serenity
of countenance; and, except that they
from time to time pronounce the words
<i>Pshaw!</i> and <i>Stuff!</i>—one would think them
the express representatives of the Pagan
gods, who <i>have eyes but do not see, and
ears but do not hear</i>.</p>

<p>I know not what may be the case at the
opera; but I can assure you there are none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of those busts among the auditories which the
street-performers at Naples gather around
them. I saw very lately a large cluster of
men, women, and children, entertained to
the highest degree, and to all appearance
made exceedingly happy, by a poor fellow
with a mask on his face, and a guitar
in his hands. He assembled his audience
by the songs he sung to the music of his
instrument, and by a thousand merry stories
he told them with infinite drollery.
This assembly was in an open place, facing
the bay, and near the palace. The old
women sat listening, with their distaffs,
spinning a kind of coarse flax, and wetting
the thread with their spittle; their grandchildren
sprawled at their feet, amused
with the twirling of the spindle. The
men and their wives, the youths and their
mistresses, sat in a circle, with their eyes
fixed on the musician, who kept them
laughing for a great part of the evening
with his stories, which he enlivened occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
with tunes upon the guitar. At
length, when the company was most numerous,
and at the highest pitch of good
humour, he suddenly pulled off his mask,
laid down his guitar, and opened a little
box which stood before him, and addressed
the audience in the following words, as
literally as I can translate them:—“Ladies
and gentlemen, there is a time
for all things; we have had enough
of jesting; innocent mirth is excellent
for the health of the body, but other
things are requisite for the health of
the soul. I will now, with your permission,
my honourable masters and mistresses,
entertain you with something
serious, and of infinitely greater importance;
something for which all of you
will have reason to bless me as long as you
live.” Here he shook out of a bag a
great number of little leaden crucifixes.—“I
am just come from the Holy House of
Loretto, my fellow christians,” continued
he, “on purpose to furnish you with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
those jewels, more precious than all the
gold of Peru, and all the pearls of the
ocean. Now, my beloved brethren and
sisters, you are afraid that I shall demand
a price for those sacred crosses,
far above your abilities, and something
correspondent with their value, by way
of indemnification for the fatigue and
expence of the long journey which I
have made on your account, all the way
from the habitation of the Blessed Virgin
to this thrice renowned city of Naples,
the riches and liberality of whose
inhabitants are celebrated all over the
globe. No, my generous Neapolitans;
I do not wish to take the advantage of
your pious and liberal dispositions, I
will not ask for those invaluable crucifixes
(all of which, let me inform you,
have touched the soot of the holy
image of the Blessed Virgin, which was
formed by the hands of St. Luke; and,
moreover, each of them has been shaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
in the Santissima Scodella, the sacred
porringer in which the Virgin made the
pap for the infant Jesus); I will not,
I say, ask an ounce of gold, no not
even a crown of silver; my regard for
you is such, that I shall let you have
them for a penny a piece.”</p>

<p>You must acknowledge, my friend, that
this morsel of eloquence was a very great
pennyworth; and when we recollect the
sums that some of our acquaintance receive
for their oratory, though they never
could produce so pathetic a specimen,
you will naturally conclude that eloquence
is a much rarer commodity in England
than in Italy.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXI">LETTER LXI.</h2>

<p class="right">Naples.</p>

<p>I have made two visits to Mount
Vesuvius, the first in company with
your acquaintance Mr. N——t. Leaving
the carriage at Herculaneum, we mounted
mules, and were attended by three men,
whose business it is to accompany strangers
up the mountain. Being arrived at a
hermitage, called Il Salvatore, we found
the road so broken and rough, that we
thought proper to leave the mules at that
place, which is inhabited by a French hermit.
The poor man must have a very bad
opinion of mankind, to choose the mouth
of Mount Vesuvius for his nearest neighbour,
in preference to their society. From
the hermitage we walked over various
fields of lava, which have burst out at
different periods. These seemed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
perfectly well known to our guides, who
mentioned their different dates as we passed.
The latest appeared, before we left
Rome, about two months ago; it was, however,
but inconsiderable in comparison of
other eruptions, there having been no
bursting of the crater, or of the side of
the mountain, as in the eruption of 1767,
so well described by Sir William Hamilton;
but only a boiling over of lava from the
mouth of the volcano, and that not in
excessive quantity; for it had done no damage
to the vineyards or cultivated parts
of the mountain, having reached no farther
than the old black lava on which
soil had not as yet been formed. I was
surprised to see this lava of the last eruption
still smoking, and in some places,
where a considerable quantity was confined
in a kind of deep path like a dry
ditch, and shaded from the light of the
Sun, it appeared of a glowing red colour.
In other places, notwithstanding its being
perfectly black and solid, it still retained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
such a degree of heat, that we could not
stand upon it for any considerable time, but
were obliged very frequently to step on the
ground, or on older lava, to cool our feet. We
had advanced a good way on a large piece of
the latest lava, which was perfectly black
and hard, and seemed cooler than the rest;
while from this we looked at a stream
of liquid lava, which flowed sluggishly
along a hollow way at some distance. I
accidentally threw my eyes below my feet,
and perceived something, which mightily
discomposed my contemplations. This was
a small stream of the same matter, gliding
to one side from beneath the black crust
on which we stood. The idea of this crust
giving way, and our sinking into the glowing
liquid which it covered, made us shift
our ground with great precipitation; which
one of our guides observing, he called out,
“Animo, animo, Signori;” and immediately
jumped on the incrustation which we had
abandoned, and danced above it, to shew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
that it was sufficiently strong, and that
we had no reason to be afraid. We afterwards
threw large stones of the heaviest
kind we could find, into this rivulet, on
whose surface they floated like cork in
water; and on thrusting a stick into the
stream, it required a considerable exertion
of strength to make it enter. About this
time the day began to overcast; this destroyed
our hopes of enjoying the view
from the top of the mountain, and we
were not tempted to ascend any farther.</p>

<p>Some time after, I went to the summit
with another party;—but I think it fair
to inform you, that I have nothing new
to say on the subject of volcanos, nor any
philosophical remarks to make upon lavas.
I have no guess of what time may be necessary
for the formation of soil, nor do I
know whether it accumulates in a regular
progression, or is accelerated or retarded
by various accidents, which may lead us
into infinite errors, when we calculate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
time by such a rule. I have not the smallest
wish to insinuate that the world is an hour
older than Moses makes it; because I
imagine those gentlemen whose calculations
differ from his, are very nearly as liable
to be mistaken as he was; because an attempt
to prove it more ancient, can be
no service to mankind; and finally, because,
unless it could at the same time be proved
that the world has acquired wisdom in
proportion to its years, such an attempt
conveys an oblique reflection on its character;
for many follies may be overlooked
and forgiven to a world of only five or
six thousand years of age, which would
be quite unpardonable at a more advanced
period of existence. Having forewarned
you that I shall treat of none of those
matters, but simply describe what I saw,
and mention perhaps a few incidents,
none of which, I confess, are of great
importance, I leave it in your choice to
ascend the mountain with me, or not, as
you please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Having proceeded on mules as far as on
the former occasion, we walked to that
part of the mountain which is almost perpendicular.
This appears of no great
height, yet those who have never before
attempted this ascent, fatigue themselves
here much more than during all the rest
of the journey, notwithstanding their being
assisted by laying hold of the belts
which the guides wear about their waists
for that purpose. This part of the mountain
appearing much shorter than it really
is, people are tempted to make a violent
effort, in the expectation of surmounting
the difficulty at once; but the cinders,
ashes, and other drossy materials, giving
way, the foot generally sinks back two-thirds
of each step; so that besides the
height being greater than it appears, you
have all the fatigue of ascending a hill
three times as high as this is in reality.
Those, therefore, who set out too briskly
at first, and do not husband their strength
at the beginning, have reason to repent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
their imprudence, being obliged to throw
many a longing look, and make many a
fruitless vow, before they, with the
wretched guide who lugs them along, can
arrive, panting and breathless, at the top;
like those young men who, having wasted
their vigour in early excesses, and brought
on premature old age, link themselves to
some ill-fated woman, who drags them,
tormenting and tormented, to the grave.</p>

<p>Those who wish to view Mount Vesuvius
to the greatest advantage, must begin
their expedition in the evening; and the
darker the succeeding night happens to be,
so much the better. By the time our company
had arrived at the top of the mountain,
there was hardly any other light than
that which issued by interrupted flashes
from the volcano.</p>

<p>Exclusive of those periods when there
are actual eruptions, the appearance and
quantity of what issues from the mountain
are very various; sometimes, for a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
space of time together, it seems in a state
of almost perfect tranquillity; nothing but
a small quantity of smoke ascending from
the volcano, as if that vast magazine of
fuel, which has kept it alive for so many
ages, was at last exhausted, and nothing
remained but the dying embers; then,
perhaps, when least expected, the cloud
of smoke thickens, and is intermixed with
flame; at other times, quantities of pumice
stone and ashes are thrown up with
a kind of hissing noise. For near a week
the mountain has been more turbulent
than at any time since the small eruption,
or rather boiling over of lava, which
took place about two months ago; and
while we remained at the top, the explosions
were of sufficient importance to satisfy
our curiosity to the utmost. They
appeared much more considerable there
than we had imagined while at a greater
distance; each of them was preceded by
a noise like thunder within the mountain;
a column of thick black smoke then issued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
out with great rapidity, followed by a
blaze of flame; and immediately after, a
shower of cinders and ashes, or red hot
stones, were thrown into the sky. This was
succeeded by a calm of a few minutes,
during which nothing issued but a moderate
quantity of smoke and flame, which
gradually increased, and terminated in
thunder and explosion as before. These
accesses and intervals continued with varied
force while we remained.</p>

<p>When we first arrived, our guides
placed us at a reasonable distance from the
mouth of the volcano, and on the side
from which the wind came, so that we
were no way incommoded by the smoke.
In this situation the wind also bore to the
opposite side the cinders, ashes, and other
fiery substances, which were thrown up;
and we ran no danger of being hurt,
except when the explosion was very violent,
and when red hot stones, and such
heavy substances, were thrown like sky-rockets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
with a great noise and prodigious
force, into the air; and even these make
such a flaming appearance, and take so
much time in descending, that they are
easily avoided.</p>

<p>Mr. Brydone, in his admirable account
of Mount Ætna, tells us, he was informed,
that, in an eruption of that mountain,
large rocks of fire were discharged, with a
noise much more terrible than that of
thunder; that the person who informed
him, reckoned from the time of their
greatest elevation till they reached the
ground, and found they took twenty-one
seconds to descend; from whence he concludes
their elevation had been seven thousand
feet. This unquestionably required
a power of projection far superior to what
Vesuvius has been known to exert. He
himself measured the height of the explosions
of the latter by the same rule;
and the stones thrown the highest, never
took above nine seconds to descend; which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
by the same method of calculating, shews
they had risen to little more than twelve
hundred feet.—A pretty tolerable height,
and might have satisfied the ambition of
Vesuvius, if the stones of Ætna had not
been said to have mounted so much higher.
But before such an excessive superiority is
granted to the latter, those who are acquainted
with Mr. Brydone will recollect,
that they have his own authority for the
one fact, and that of another person for
the other.</p>

<p>After having remained some time at the
place where they were posted by the
guides, our company grew bolder, as they
became more familiarised to the object.
Some made the circuit of the volcano, and
by that means increased the risque of being
wounded by the stones thrown out. Your
young friend Jack was a good deal hurt
by a fall, as he ran to avoid a large portion
of some fiery substance, which seemed
to be falling directly on his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Considering the rash and frolicsome
disposition of some who visit this mountain,
it is very remarkable that so few fatal
accidents happen. I have heard of young
English gentlemen betting, who should
venture farthest, or remain longest, near
the mouth of the Volcano. A very dreadful
event had nearly taken place while
our company remained. The bank, if it
may be so called, on which some of them
had stood when they looked into the Volcano,
actually fell in before we left the
summit of the mountain. This made an
impression on all present, and inclined
them to abandon so treacherous a neighbourhood.
The steep hill of dross and
cinders, which we had found it so difficult
to ascend, we descended in a twinkling;
but, as the night was uncommonly dark,
we had much trouble in passing over the
rough valley between that and the Hermitage,
near which the mules waited. I
ought to be ashamed, however, to mention
the fatigue of this expedition; for two ladies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
natives of Geneva, formed part of
the company. One of them, big with
child, accompanied her husband as far as
the Hermitage, and was then with difficulty
persuaded to go back; the other actually
went to the summit, and returned
with the rest of the company.</p>

<p>Before we set out for Naples, we were
refreshed, at a little inn at the bottom of
the mountain, with some glasses of a very
generous and palatable wine, called <i>Lachrima
Christi</i>; and experienced the truth
of what an Italian Poet observed, that the
effects of this wine form a strong contrast
with its name:</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXII">LETTER LXII.</h2>

<p class="right">Naples.</p>

<p>Your account of our Friend’s state
of health gives me much concern;
the more, as I cannot approve the change
he has made of a physician. You say, the
doctor, under whose care he is at present,
has employed his mind so entirely in medical
researches, that he scarcely displays a
grain of common sense, when the conversation
turns on any other subject; and
that, although he seems opinionative, vain,
and ostentatious in his profession, and full
of false and absurd ideas in the common
affairs of life, yet he is a very able physician,
and has performed many wonderful
cures. Be assured, my dear Sir, that this
is impossible; for medical skill is not like
the rod of an inchanter, which may be
found accidentally, and which transfers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
its miraculous powers indiscriminately to
a blockhead or a man of sense. The
number of weak, gossipping men, who have
made fortunes by this profession, do not
prove the contrary. I do not say that men
of that kind cannot make fortunes; I only
assert they are not the most likely to cure
diseases. An interest with apothecaries,
nurses, and a few talkative old ladies, will
enable them to do the first; but a clear
understanding, and a considerable share of
natural sagacity, are qualities essentially
necessary for the second, and for every
business which requires reflection. Without
these, false inferences will be drawn
from experience itself; and learning will
tend to confirm a man in his errors, and to
render him more completely a coxcomb.</p>

<p>The profession of physic is that, of all
others, in which the generality of mankind
have the fewest lights, by which they
can discern the abilities of its professors;
because the studies which lead to it are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
more out of the road of usual education,
and the practice more enveloped in technical
terms and hieroglyphical signs. But
I imagine the safest criterion by which
men, who have not been bred to that profession,
can form a judgment of those
who have, is, the degree of sagacity and
penetration they discover on subjects equally
open to mankind in general, and which
ought to be understood by all who live in
society. You do not mention particularly
what has been prescribed by either; only
that the former physician seemed to rely
almost entirely on exercise and regimen,
whereas the present flatters our friend
with a speedy cure, by the help of the
Pectoral and Balsamic medicines which
he orders in such abundance, and which
he declares are so efficacious in <i>pulmonary
consumptions</i>.</p>

<p>Having lamented with you the mournful
events which render the name of that
disease peculiarly alarming to you, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
knowing your friendly solicitude about
Mr. ——, I do not wonder at your earnest
desire to know something of the nature of
a distemper with which he is threatened,
and which has proved fatal to so many of
our friends. But I am surprised that you
have not chosen a more enlightened instructor,
when you have so many around
you. Though conscious that I have no
just claim to all the obliging expressions
which your partiality to my opinions has
prompted you to make use of, yet I am
too much flattered by some of them, to refuse
complying with your request. My
sentiments, such as they are, will at least
have the merit of being clearly understood.
I shall observe your prohibition, not to refer
you to any medical book; and shall
carefully avoid all technical terms, which
you so much abominate. With regard to
your shewing my Letter to any of the faculty;
if you find yourself so inclined, I
have not the smallest objection; for those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
who have the greatest knowledge in their
profession, are best acquainted with its uncertainty,
and most indulgent to the mistakes
or errors of others.</p>

<p>Alas, my friend! how is it possible that
physicians should avoid mistakes? If the
ablest mechanic were to attempt to remedy
the irregular movements of a watch, while
he remained ignorant of the structure and
manner of acting of some of the principal
springs, would he not be in danger of doing
harm instead of good? Physicians are
in the situation of such a mechanic; for,
although it is evident that the nerves are
the organs of motion and sensation, yet
their structure is not known. Some anatomists
assert they are impervious cords;
others, that they are slender tubes, containing
a fluid. But what the nature of
this fluid is; whether it serves only to
nourish the nerves themselves, or is the
medium by which they convey feeling and
the power of motion to other parts, is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
ascertained even by those who argue for its
existence; far less is it explained in what
manner ideas, formed within the brain,
can, by the means of solid cords, or by a
fluid contained in tubes, communicate motion
at pleasure to the legs and arms. We
are ignorant why the will, which has no
influence over the motion of an animal’s
heart, should find the feet obedient to her
dictates; and we can no more explain how a
man can move one leg over the other by
volition, or the mere act of willing, than
how he could, by the same means, move
Ossa on the top of Olympus. The one
happens every moment, the other would
be considered as a miracle; but they are
equally unaccountable. While parts so
infinitely essential to life are not understood,
instead of being surprised that so
many diseases baffle the skill of the physician,
we have more reason to be astonished
that any can be alleviated or cured by his
art.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The pen of the satirist, no doubt, may
be fairly aimed against the presumption
and ignorance of many individuals of this,
as of every other profession; but cannot
with justice be directed against the art itself:
since, in spite of the obscurity which
still involves some parts of the animal economy,
many disorders are relieved, and
some of the severest and most disagreeable
to which the human body is liable, are
cured with certainty by the art of medicine.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for mankind, and in a
particular manner for the inhabitants of
Great Britain, the pulmonary consumption
is not of the number.</p>

<p>This disease may originate from various
causes:</p>

<p>1st. An external bruise or wound.</p>

<p>2d. The disease called pleurisy, including
in that term an inflammation of the
lungs themselves, as well as the membrane
which covers them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>3d. The bursting of some of the blood-vessels
of the lungs, independent of external
injury, and owing to a faulty conformation
of the chest, and the slenderness
of the vessels.</p>

<p>4th. Certain small tumours, called tubercles,
in the lungs.</p>

<p>The first cause I have mentioned is an
external bruise or wound.</p>

<p>An accident of that kind happening to
the lungs, is more dangerous and difficult
to cure, than when the same takes place
in most other parts of the body; because
the lungs are vital organs, essentially necessary
to life, and when their motion is
impaired, other animal functions are
thereby injured; because they are of an
uncommonly delicate texture, in which
a rupture having once taken place, will
be apt to increase; because they are in constant
motion and exposed to the access of
external air, both of which circumstances
are unfavourable to the healing of wounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
and because the mass of blood distributed
to the whole body passes previously through
the lungs, and consequently the blood-vessels
of this organ are more numerous
than those of any other part of the
body.</p>

<p>When we consider these peculiarities, it
is natural to conclude, that every wound
of the lungs must necessarily prove mortal;
but experience has taught the contrary.
Many wounds of the lungs heal
of themselves, by what is called, the first
intention. The physician may prevent a
fever, by ordering the patient to lose blood
in proper quantities, and he may regulate
the diet; but the cure must be
left to nature, which she will perform
with greater certainty, if she is not disturbed
by any of those balsams which the
wounded are sometimes directed to swallow
on such occasions. But when the
wound, either from injudicious treatment,
or from its size, or from the bad habit of
the patient, degenerates into an ulcer attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
with hectic symptoms, the disease
must be treated as if it had arisen from any
of the other causes.</p>

<p>The pleurisy, or inflammation of the
lungs, is a disease more frequent in cold
countries than in mild; in the spring than
in the other seasons; and more apt to
seize people of a sanguine constitution than
others.</p>

<p>Plentiful and repeated bleedings, fomentations,
blisters near the affected part, and
a cooling, diluting regimen, generally remove
it, without its leaving any bad consequence.
Sometimes, by the omission of
bleeding in due quantity at the beginning,
and sometimes in spite of all possible care,
it terminates in an abscess, which, on
bursting, may suffocate the patient; or, if
the matter is coughed up, becomes an
open ulcer, and produces the disease in
question.</p>

<p>The third cause of the pulmonary consumption
above mentioned, is, a spitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of blood, from the bursting of vessels
of the lungs, independent of external
wound or bruise. People of a fair complexion,
delicate skin, slender make, long
neck, and narrow chest, are more subject
to this than others. Those who have a
predisposition to this complaint, by their
form, are most apt to be attacked after
their full growth: women from fifteen to
three-and-thirty; men two or three years
later. In Great Britain, a spitting of
blood generally occurs to those predisposed
to it, in the spring, or beginning of summer,
when the weather suddenly changes
from cold to excessive hot; and when the heat
is supposed to rarify the blood, before the
solids are proportionably relaxed from the
contracted state they acquire during the
cold of winter. When a spitting of blood
happens to a person who has actually lost
brothers or sisters, or other near relations,
by the pulmonary consumption, as that circumstance
gives reason to suspect a family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
taint or predisposition, the case will, on
that account, be more dangerous.</p>

<p>Violent exercise may occasion the rupture
of blood-vessels in the lungs, even in
those who have no hereditary disposition
to such an accident; it ought therefore
to be carefully avoided by all who
have. Violent exercise, in the spring, is
more dangerous than in other seasons;
and, when taken at the top of high mountains,
by those who do not usually reside
there, it has been considered as more dangerous
than in vallies. The sudden diminution
of the weight of the atmosphere,
co-operating with the exercise, renders
the vessels more apt to break. Of all
things the most pernicious to people predisposed
to a spitting of blood, is, playing
upon wind-instruments. Previous to the
spitting of blood, some perceive an uneasiness
in the chest, an oppression on the
breath, and a saltish taste in the spittle;
but these symptoms are not constant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing can be more insidious than the
approaches of this disease sometimes are.
The substance of the lungs, which is so full
of blood-vessels, is not supplied so liberally
with nerves; the lungs, therefore, may
be materially affected, before danger is indicated
by acute pain. And it sometimes
happens, that people of the make above
described are, in the bloom of life, and
generally in the spring of the year, seized
with a slight cough, which gradually increases,
without pain, soreness in the
breast, difficulty of respiration, or spitting
of blood. A slow fever supervenes every
night, which remits every morning, with
sweats. These symptoms augment daily;
and, in spite of early attention, and what
is thought the best advice, the unsuspecting
victims gradually sink into their graves.</p>

<p>Those who by their make, or by the disease
having in former instances appeared in
their family, are predisposed to this complaint,
ought to be peculiarly attentive in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
article of diet. A spare and cooling regimen
is the best. They should avoid violent exercise,
and every other exciting cause;
and use the precaution of losing blood in
the spring. If their circumstances permit,
they ought to pass the cold months in a
mild climate; but, if they are obliged to
remain during the winter in Great Britain,
let them wear flannel next the skin, and
use every other precaution against catching
colds.</p>

<p>The fourth cause above enumerated is,
tubercles in the lungs.</p>

<p>The moist, soggy, and changeable weather,
which prevails in Great Britain, renders
its inhabitants more liable, than those
of milder and more uniform climates, to
catarrhs, rheumatisms, pleurisies, and
other diseases proceeding from obstructed
perspiration. The same cause subjects the
inhabitants of Great Britain to obstructions
of the glands, scrophulous complaints, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
tubercles in the substance of the lungs.
The scrophulous disease is more frequent
than is generally imagined. For one person
in whom it appears by swellings in the
glands below the chin, and other external
marks, many have the internal glands affected
by it. This is well known to those
who are accustomed to open dead bodies.
On examining the bodies of such as have
died of the pulmonary consumption, besides
the open ulcers in the lungs, many
little hard tumours or tubercles are generally
found; some, with matter; others,
on being cut open, discover a little blueish
spot, of the size of a small lead shot.
Here the suppuration, or formation of
matter, is just going to begin; and in some
the tubercle is perfectly hard, and the colour
whitish, throughout its whole substance.
Tubercles may remain for a considerable
time in the lungs, in this indolent
state, without much inconveniency;
but, when excited to inflammation by frequent
catarrhs, or other irritating causes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
matter is formed, they break, and produce
an ulcer. Care and attention may prevent
tubercles from inflammation, or may
prevent <i>that</i> from terminating in the formation
of matter; but when matter is
actually formed, and the tubercle has become
an abscess, no remedy can stop its
progress. It must go on till it bursts. If
this happens near any of the large air-vessels,
immediate suffocation may ensue; but,
for the most part, the matter is coughed
up.</p>

<p>From the circumstances above enumerated
of the delicate texture, constant motion,
and numerous blood-vessels of the
lungs, it is natural to imagine, that a
breach of this nature in their substance
will be still more difficult to heal than a
wound from an external cause. So unquestionably
it is; yet there are many instances
of even this kind of breach being repaired;
the matter expectorated diminishing in quantity
every day, and the ulcer gradually
healing; not, surely, by the power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
medicine, but by the constant disposition
and tendency which exists in nature, by
inscrutable means of her own, to restore
health to the human body.</p>

<p>It may be proper to observe, that those
persons whose formation of body renders
them most liable to a spitting of blood,
have also a greater predisposition than
others to tubercles in the lungs. The disease,
called the spasmodic asthma, has
been reckoned among the causes of the
pulmonary consumption. It would require
a much greater degree of confidence
in a man’s own judgment, than I have in
mine, to assert, that this complaint has no
tendency to produce tubercles in the
lungs; but I may say, with truth, that I
have often known the spasmodic asthma,
in the most violent degree, attended with
the most alarming symptoms, continue to
harass the patients for a long period of
time, and at length suddenly disappear,
without ever returning; the persons who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
have been thus afflicted, enjoying perfect
health for many years after. It is not
probable that tubercles were formed in
any of these cases; and it is certain they
were not in some, whose bodies were
opened after their deaths, which happened
from other distempers, the asthma having
disappeared several years before.</p>

<p>Certain eruptions of the skin, attended
with fever, particularly the small-pox, and
still oftener the measles, leave after them
a foundation for the pulmonary consumption.
From whichever of the causes above
enumerated this disease takes its origin,
when once an ulcer, attended with a hectic
fever, is formed in the lungs, the case is,
in the highest degree, dangerous. When
it ends fatally, the symptoms are, a quick
pulse, and a sensation of cold, while
the patient’s skin, to the feeling of
every other person, is hot; irregular shiverings,
a severe cough, expectoration of
matter streaked with blood, morning sweats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
a circumscribed spot of a crimson colour
on the cheeks, heat of the palms of the
hands, excessive emaciation, crooking of
the nails, swelling of the legs, giddiness,
delirium, soon followed by death.</p>

<p>These symptoms do not appear in every
case. Although the emaciation is greater
in this disease than in any other, yet the
appetite frequently remains strong and unimpaired
to the last; and although delirium
sometimes comes before death, yet
in many cases the senses seem perfect and
intire; except in one particular, that in
spite of all the foregoing symptoms, the
patient often entertains the fullest hopes
of recovery to the last moment.</p>

<p>Would to heaven it were as easy to
point out the cure, as to describe the symptoms
of a disease of such a formidable
nature, and against which the powers of
medicine have been directed with such
bad success, that there is reason to fear,
its fatal termination has been oftener accelerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
than retarded by the means employed
to remove it! To particularise
the drugs which have been long
in use, and have been honoured with
the highest encomiums for their great
efficacy in healing inward bruises, ulcers
of the lungs, and confirmed consumptions,
would in many instances be pointing out,
what ought to be shunned as pernicious,
and in others what ought to be neglected
as futile.</p>

<p>Salt water, and some of the mineral
springs, which are unquestionably beneficial
in scrophulous and other distempers, have
been found hurtful, or at least inefficacious,
in the consumption; there is no sufficient
reason to depend on a course of these, or
any medicine at present known, for preventing
or dissolving tubercles in the
lungs. Mercury, which has been found
so powerful in disposing other ulcers to
heal, has no good effect on ulcers of that
organ;—though some physicians imagine
it may be of service in the beginning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
dissolve tubercles, before they begin to
suppurate; but as there is no absolute evidence,
during life, of indolent tubercles
being formed, there can be none that
mercury cures them.</p>

<p>Various kinds of gums, with the natural
and artificial balsams, were long supposed
to promote the healing of external
wounds and ulcers, and on that account
were made the basis of a vast variety of
ointments and plaisters. It was afterwards
imagined, that the same remedies,
administered internally, would
have the same effect on internal ulcers;
and of course many of those gums
and balsams were prescribed in various
forms for the pulmonary consumption.
The reasoning on which this practice
was established, however, seems a little
shallow, and is far from being conclusive;
for although it were granted, that these
balsams contributed to the cure of wounds,
when applied directly to the part, it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
not follow that they could carry their
healing powers, unimpaired, from the stomach
to the lungs, through the whole
process of digestion. But more accurate
surgery having made it manifest, that the
granulations which spring up to supply
the loss of substance in external wounds,
and the healing or skinning over of all
kinds of sores, proceeds from no active
virtue in the plaisters or ointments with
which they are dressed, but is entirely the
work of nature, and best performed when
the mildest substances, or even dry lint
only is applied; and that heating gums,
resins, and balsams, rather retard than
promote their cure; the internal use of
such remedies ought to be rejected now,
on the same principles they were adapted
formerly.</p>

<p>No kind of reasoning ought to have
weight, when opposed by fair experience.
But physicians have formed contrary and
opposite conclusions, with respect to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
effect of the natural and artificial balsams,
even when they have laid all theory and
reasoning aside, and decided on their
powers from practice and experiment
only. This is sufficient to prove, at least,
that their efficacy is very problematical.
For my own part, after the fairest trials,
and the most accurate observations I have
been able to make, I cannot say that I
ever knew them of service in any hectic
complaint proceeding from an ulcer in the
lungs; and I have generally found those
physicians, on whose judgment I have more
reliance than on my own, of the same
opinion.</p>

<p>It is far from being uncommon to see
a cure retarded, not to say any thing
stronger, by the means employed to
hasten it; and physicians who found their
practice on theoretical reasonings, are not
the only persons to whom this misfortune
may happen. Those who profess to
take experience for their sole guide, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
it is not directed by candour, and enlightened
by natural sagacity, are liable to
the same. A man may, for twenty years,
order a medicine, which has in every instance
done a little harm, though not always
so much as to prevent nature from
removing the complaint at last; and if the
reputation of this medicine should ever be
attacked, he may bring his twenty years
experience in support of it. It ought to be
remembered, that as often as the animal
constitution is put out of order, by accident
or distemper, nature endeavours to restore
health. Happily she has many resources,
and various methods of accomplishing her
purpose; and very often she succeeds best
without medical assistance. But medical
assistance being given, she frequently succeeds
<i>notwithstanding</i>; and it sometimes
happens, that both physician and patient
are convinced, that the means which did
not prevent have actually performed the
cure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>A peasant is seized with a shivering,
followed by feverishness, and accompanied
with a slight cough—he goes to bed, and
excessive heat and thirst prompt him to
drink plentifully of plain water; on the
second or third day a copious sweat bursts
from all his pores, and terminates the disorder.
A person of fortune is seized with
the same symptoms, arising from the same
cause, and which would have been cured
by the same means, in the same space of
time; but the apothecary is called, who
immediately sends pectoral linctuses to remove
the cough, and afterwards gives a
vomit, to remove the nausea which the
linctuses have occasioned: the heat and fever
augment; the physician is called; he
orders the patient to be blooded, to abate
the violence of the fever, and gives a little
physic on some other account. All this
prevents the natural crisis by sweat; and
the patient being farther teased by
draughts or powders every two or three
hours, nature cannot shake off the fever so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
soon by six or seven days, as she would
have done had she been left to herself. She
generally does her business at last, however;
and then the physician and apothecary
glory in the happy effects of their
skill, and receive the grateful thanks of
their patient for having cured him of a
dangerous fever.</p>

<p>Every body of common penetration, at
all conversant in medical matters, must
have seen enough to convince them that
the above description is not exaggerated;
but it is not to be inferred from this, that
the art of medicine is of no use to mankind.
There are many diseases in which
nature sinks, without medical assistance. It
is the part of the penetrating and experienced
physician to distinguish these from
others, and leave it to the knavish and
weak to assume the merit of cures in cases
where they know, or ought to know, that
medicine can do nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Some physicians, who have abandoned
the other resins and gums, as useless or
hurtful in hectic complaints, still adhere to
myrrh as a beneficial medicine; but from
what I can learn, the cases in which this
gum has been thought serviceable, are hectic
complaints, from debility, in consequence
of excessive evacuations of various
kinds, and not proceeding from ulcerated
lungs. After it is fully established that
myrrh is of use in such instances, it will
still be worthy of investigation, whether it
is of more or less than Jesuits bark. I have
repeatedly mentioned blood-letting, and a
spare, diluting regimen, as the most powerful
means of preventing and curing all
affections of the lungs that depend on inflammation.
In the case of external
wounds, or bruises of the lungs, this method
facilitates the immediate cure by the
first intention. It is the chief thing to be
depended on for the cure of pleurisies; and
it is often owing to a neglect, or too sparing
an use of this evacuation, that the complaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
terminates in an abscess. In people
predisposed by the form of their bodies, or
the nature of their constitutions, to a spitting
of blood, it may prevent the turgid vessels
from bursting; and in those who have tubercles
in the lungs, it is of the greatest
utility, by preventing those tumours from
inflaming, and becoming ulcers; but after
the ulcers are actually formed, I have great
doubts with regard to the propriety of attempting
a cure by repeated bleedings,
even in small quantities. This method has
been often tried; but I fear the success with
which it has been attended, gives no encouragement
to continue the practice. That
symptoms may be such, in every period of
this disease, as to require this evacuation,
is not to be denied; but there is a great
difference in the application of what is considered
as an occasional palliative, and that
from which we expect a radical cure. In
the one case, it will only be used when some
particular symptom strongly urges; in the
other, it will be used at stated intervals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
whether the symptoms press or not; and
may tend to weaken the already debilitated
patient, without our having the consolation
of knowing, with certainty, that it has had
any other effect.</p>

<p>Blisters do not weaken so much; they
are of undoubted use in pleurisies; perhaps,
by exciting external inflammation, they
may contribute to draw off the inflammatory
disposition within the breast: perhaps—But
in whatever way they act, I imagine
I have frequently seen blisters and setons,
particularly the latter, of considerable service,
even after the symptoms indicated the
existence of an ulcer in the lungs.</p>

<p>As for the numerous forms of electuaries,
lohochs, and linctuses, composed of oils,
gums, and syrups, and by the courtesy of
dispensatory writers called <i>pectoral</i>; I am
convinced they are of no manner of service
in this complaint, and seldom have any
other effect than that of loading the stomach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
and impairing the digestion of salutary
food. So far from being of any permanent
service to the disease, they cannot
be depended on for giving even a temporary
relief to the cough; when that symptom
becomes troublesome, gentle opiates will be
found the best palliatives. Some practitioners
object to these medicines, on a supposition
that they check expectoration; but
they only seem to have this effect, by lulling
the irritation to cough; the same quantity
will be expectorated in the morning,
after the influence of the opiate is over. It is
surely better that the matter should accumulate,
and the patient spit it up at once, than
allow him to be kept from rest, and teased
with coughing and spitting through the whole
night. These palliatives, however, are to be
managed with great caution; never exhibited
while the patient enjoys a tolerable share of
<i>natural</i> rest. Small doses should be given
at first, and not increased without absolute
necessity. Exhibited in this manner, they
cannot do harm; and those who reject the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
assistance of a class of medicines, which
afford ease and tranquillity in the most deplorable
state of this disease, ought to give
better proofs than have hitherto appeared,
that they are able to procure their patients
more valuable and lasting comforts than
those they deprive them of.</p>

<p>The known efficacy of the Peruvian
bark, in many distempers, especially in intermittent
fevers; the remission of the symptoms,
which happens regularly every day at a
particular stage of the pulmonary consumption,
and in some degree gives it the appearance
of an intermittent, joined to the
failure of all other remedies, prompted
physicians to make trial of that noble medicine
in this disease. In consequence of
these trials, the bark is now pretty generally
acknowledged to be serviceable in
hectical complaints, proceeding from debility,
and other causes, exclusive of ulcerated
lungs; but when the disease proceeds
from this cause, the bark is supposed, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
some very respectable physicians, always to
do harm. I am most clearly of the first
opinion, and perhaps it would not become
me to dispute the second. It may be permitted,
however, to observe, that the most
discerning practitioners may be led into a
notion, that a very safe medicine does harm,
when it is exhibited at the worst stage of a
disease, in which hardly any medicine
whatever has been found to do good. In
every stage of this disease, elixir of vitriol
may be used. It is a pleasant and safe medicine,
but particularly efficacious when
the patient is troubled with wasting sweats.</p>

<p>Having, in obedience to your request,
delivered my sentiments freely, you will
perceive, that, besides the objections already
mentioned to the person under whose
care our friend is at present, I cannot approve
of his being directed to take so many
drugs, or of his being detained in town, at
a season when he may enjoy, in the country,
what is preferable to all medicine; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
mean air, exercise, and, let me even add,
diet.</p>

<p>Had I known of our friend’s complaints
earlier, I should have advised him to have
met the advancing spring in the South of
France; but at the season in which you
will receive this letter, the moderate
warmth, and refreshing verdure of England,
are preferable to the sultry heats
and scorched fields of the South. From the
view I have of his complaints, I can have
no hesitation in advising you to endeavour
to prevail on him to quit his drugs, and to
leave London without delay. Since he
bears riding on horseback so well, let him
enjoy that exercise in an atmosphere freed
from the smoke of the town, and impregnated
with the flavour of rising plants and
green herbage; a flavour which may with
more truth be called <i>pectoral</i>, than any of
the heating resins, or loathsome oils, on
which that term has been prostituted. Let
him pass the summer in drinking the waters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
and riding around the environs of
Bristol. It will be easy for him to find a
house in the free air of the country, at
some distance from that town; and it
will be of use to have an additional reason
for rising early, and riding every morning.
It is of the greatest importance that he continue
that exercise every day that the weather
will permit: a little cloudiness of the
sky should not fright him from it; there is
no danger of catching cold during the continuation
of that movement which assists
digestion, promotes the determination of
blood from the lungs to the surface of the
body, and is more salutary in the morning
than after dinner.</p>

<p>With respect to diet, he should carefully
observe the important rule of taking food
frequently, in small quantities, and never
making a full meal; that the digestive organs
may not be overpowered, or the vessels
charged with too large a quantity of
chyle at a time; which never fails to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
on oppressive breathing, and augments
the fever and flushing, which in some degree
succeeds every repast.</p>

<p>Since all kinds of milk are found to disagree
with his constitution, that nourishment,
which is in general so well adapted
to similar complaints, must be omitted, and
light broths, with vegetable food, particularly
of the farinaceous kind, substituted in
its place.</p>

<p>Acids, especially the native acid of vegetables,
are remarkably agreeable and refreshing
to all who labour under the heat,
oppression, and languor, which accompany
hectic complaints. It is surprising what a
quantity of the juice of lemons the constitution
will bear, without any inconveniency,
when it is accustomed to it by degrees;
and in those cases where it does not
occasion pains in the stomach and bowels,
or other immediate inconveniencies, it has
been thought to have a good effect in abating
the force of the hectic fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>I have met with two cases, since I have
been last abroad, in both of which there
seemed to be a quicker recovery than I ever
saw, from the same symptoms. The first
was that of a young lady, of about seventeen
years of age, and apparently of a very
healthy constitution. In bad weather,
during the spring, she caught cold: this
being neglected in the beginning, gradually
grew worse. When physicians were at
length consulted, their prescriptions seemed
to have as bad an effect as her own neglect.
By the middle of summer her cough was
incessant, accompanied with hectic fever
and flushings, irregular shiverings, morning
sweats, emaciation, expectoration of
purulent phlegm streaked with blood, and
every indication of an open ulcer in the
lungs. In this desperate state she was carried
from the town to a finely situated village
in Switzerland, where, for several
months, she lived in the middle of a vineyard,
on ripe grapes and bread. She had
been directed to a milk and vegetable diet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
in general. Her own taste inclined her to
the grapes, which she continued, on finding,
that, with this diet only, she was less languid,
and of a more natural coolness, and that
the cough, fever, and all the other symptoms
gradually abated. She seemed to be brought
from the jaws of death by the change of air,
and this regimen only; and she returned to
her own home in high spirits, and with the
look and vigour of health. The ensuing
winter, after being heated with dancing at
the house of a friend, she walked home in
a cold night; the cough, spitting of blood,
and other symptoms immediately returned,
and she died three months after.</p>

<p>In the other case, there was not such a
degree of fever, but there was an expectoration
of matter, frequently streaked with
blood, and evident signs of an ulcer in the
lungs. The person who laboured under
these symptoms, had tried the usual remedies
of pectorals, pills, linctuses, &amp;c. with
the usual success. He grew daily worse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
He had formerly found much relief from
bleeding, but had left it off for many
months, on a supposition that it had lost all
effect; and he had allowed an issue to be
healed, on the same supposition; though
he still persevered in a milk regimen. I
mentioned to him the case of the young
lady, as it is above recited. He immediately
took the resolution to confine himself
to bread and grapes for almost his only
food. I advised him at the same time to
have the issue opened, and to continue that
drain for some time; but this he did not
comply with. He forsook, however, the
town for the country, and passed as much
of the morning on horseback, as he could
bear without fatigue. He soon was able
to bear more; and after about three weeks
or a month, his cough had greatly abated.
When he had persisted in this regimen between
two and three months, he had very
little cough; and what he spit up was pure
phlegm, unmixed with blood or matter.
He has now been well above a year; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
although I understand that he occasionally
takes animal food, he has hitherto felt no
inconveniency from it. He passed the
second autumn, as he had done the first, at
a house in the country, surrounded with
vineyards. The greater part of his food
consisted of ripe grapes and bread. With
such a diet, he had not occasion for much
drink of any kind; what he used was
simple water, and he made an ample provision
of grapes for the succeeding winter.</p>

<p>Though I have no idea that there is any
specific virtue in grapes, for the cure of
the pulmonary consumption, or that they
are greatly preferable to some other cooling,
sub-acid, mild fruit, equally agreeable to the
taste, provided any such can be found; yet
I thought it right to particularize what was
used on those two occasions; leaving it to
others to determine, what share of the
happy consequences I have enumerated
were owing to the change of air, how much
may have flowed from the exercise, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
much from the regimen, and whether there
is reason to think, that the favourable turn
in both cases depended on other circumstances,
unobserved by me.</p>

<p>I have now, my dear Sir, complied with
your request; and although I have endeavoured
to avoid technical verbosity, and all
unnecessary detail, yet I find my letter has
swelled to a greater size than I expected.
I shall be exceedingly happy to hear that
any hint I have given has been serviceable to
our friend. If the cough should still continue,
after he has passed two or three months at
Bristol, I imagine the most effectual thing
he can do will be, to take a voyage to this
place; he will by that means escape the
severity of a British winter. The voyage
itself will be of service, and at the end of it
he will have the benefit of the mild air of
the Campagna Felice, be refreshed and
nourished by the finest grapes, and, when
tired of riding, he will have continual opportunities
of sailing in this charming bay.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXIII">LETTER LXIII.</h2>

<p class="right">Naples.</p>

<p>As I was walking a few days since in
the street with two of our countrymen,
T—— and N——, we met some
people carrying the corpse of a man on an
open bier, and others following in a
kind of procession. The deceased was a
tradesman, whose widow had bestowed the
utmost attention in dressing him to the
greatest advantage on this solemn occasion;
he had a perfectly new suit of
clothes, a laced hat upon his head, ruffles,
his hair finely powdered, and a large
blooming nosegay in his left hand, while
the right was very gracefully stuck in his
side. It is the custom at Naples to
carry every body to church in full dress
soon after their death, and the nearest relations
display the magnitude of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
grief by the magnificent manner in which
they decorate the corpse. This poor woman,
it seems, was quite inconsolable,
and had ornamented the body of her late
husband with a profusion she could ill
afford. When the corpse arrives in church,
the service is read over it. That ceremony
being performed, and the body carried
home, it is considered as having no farther
occasion for fine clothes, but is generally
stript to the shirt, and buried privately.</p>

<p>“Can any thing be more ridiculous,”
says N——, “than to trick a man out in
his bed clothes after his death?” “Nothing,”
replied T——; “unless it be
to order a fantastical dress at a greater
expence on purpose, as if the dead
would not be satisfied with the clothes
they wore when alive, but delighted in
long flowing robes in a particular style
of their own.”</p>

<p>T—— has long resided abroad, and
now prefers many foreign customs to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of his own country, which frequently involves
him in disputes with his countrymen.</p>

<p>The Princess of —— drove past.
“There she goes,” says N——, “with
her cavalieros, her volantis, and all
the splendour of a sovereign; yet the
wife of a plain English gentleman is in
a far more enviable situation. With all
her titles and her high rank, she is a
meer servant of the Queen’s, a dependant
on the caprice of another; a frown
from her Majesty would annihilate
her.” “Those who are <i>nothing</i>, exclusive
of court favour,” replied T——,
“ought not be censured for devoting their
time to court attendance. But did you
never hear of any who are dazzled
with the glitter of court shackels in the
boasted land of liberty; people whom
riches, rank, and the most flattering
favours of fortune cannot make independent;
whose minds seem the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
abject, as their situation lays them under
the less necessity of remaining in
servitude; who, withered with age, and
repining with envy, sacrifice every domestic
duty, and stalk around the mansions
of royalty, as ghosts are said to
haunt those abodes in which they most
delighted when they enjoyed life and
vigour?” “Well, well,” says N——,
“let us say no more about them, since
we are agreed, that, of all the old tapestry
of courts, those grotesque figures,
who, without the confidence of those
they serve, continue to the last exhibiting
their antique countenances at birthday
balls, and in the assemblies of youth
and beauty, are the most ridiculous.”
At that instant the Queen passed in her
coach with the royal children, and N——
made some comparative remarks in his
usual style; to which T—— replied, “In
this particular I acknowledge the happiness
of Great Britain. I presume not
to make comparisons; the great character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
you have mentioned defies censure,
and is far superior to my praise. But
I must observe, it appears singular that
you, who affect to despise all other
countries, and seem of opinion, that
what is most valuable in nature is always
the product of <i>England</i>, should bring
your brightest illustration of that opinion
from <i>Germany</i>.”</p>

<p>T——, perceiving the advantage he
had gained over his antagonist, proceeded
vigorously to censure, what he called, the
absurd partiality of the English in their
own favour; and observed, that it would
be fortunate for them, if the other nations
of Europe would allow them but a few
of the numerous good qualities which they
so lavishly attribute to themselves. He
severely attacked the common people, and
denied them even the character of good-nature,
which they have been thought to
possess in an eminent degree. He declared
them to be rough and insolent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
their manners (for the truth of this he
appealed to the opinion of all their neighbours),
cruel in their dispositions (as a
proof of which he instanced some of
their favourite diversions), and absurd
in their prejudices, which appears by their
hatred and contempt of other nations; by
all of whom, he asserted, they were in return
most cordially abhorred. “How, indeed,
can it be otherwise,” continued he, “considering
the rough, boisterous nature of
their weather?” He then expatiated on
the fertility of Italy, and the mild serenity
of the climate; to which he partly attributed
the fertile genius and mild character
of the Italians. “No doubt,” he said,
“moral causes might contribute to the same
effect; for more pains were taken to cultivate
and encourage good and quiet dispositions
in the common people here than
in England. They were accustomed to
perform their religious duties more regularly;
they had frequent opportunities of
hearing the most excellent music in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
churches; they were instructed in history
by orators in the street, and were made
acquainted with the beauties of their
best poets in the same manner. All these
causes united must necessarily enlarge
their minds, and make them the most
gentle, humane, and ingenious people in
the world.” N—— shook his head, as if
he laid little stress on the others reasoning.
For my own part, I remained silent, being
desirous that the dispute should go on between
the two who had begun it.</p>

<p>Continuing our walk a little without
the town, we saw a crowd of people looking
over a wall, which formed one side of
a square, expressly built for the purpose of
bating cattle with bull dogs. It is imagined
that this renders their flesh more
tender and agreeable to the taste; and this
is considered as a sufficient reason for torturing
great numbers of bulls, oxen, and
cows, before they are slaughtered for the
markets; we found a multitude of spectators
enjoying this amusement. “Pray,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
says Mr. N——, addressing himself to
T——, “do you imagine this humane
practice, and the complacency which
these refined spectators seem to take in
beholding it, proceed from the mildness
of the climate, the pains bestowed
in teaching the people the duties of christianity,
the enlargement of their minds
by history and poetry, or from the gentle
influence of music upon their dispositions?”
Then turning from Mr.
T—— to me, he continued, “Not satisfied
with knocking the poor animals on
the head, those unfeeling epicures put
them to an hour’s additional torture,
merely to gratify a caprice of their corrupted
palates.”</p>

<p>“Of all subjects,” replied T——, recovering
himself from the confusion into
which N——’s questions had thrown him,
“those who take upon them to be the
panegyrists of the English nation, ought
to avoid mentioning that species of epicurism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
which depends on eating, lest
they be put in mind of whipping pigs
to death, their manner of collaring
brawn, crimping fish, and other refinements
peculiar to that humane good-natured
people.”</p>

<p>N—— was just going to reply, when a
large bull, rendered outrageous by the
stones which the populace were throwing
at him, ran suddenly towards the gate at
the instant the keepers were opening it
on some other account; which threw them
into such confusion, that they had not time
to shut it before the bull burst out on the
multitude. He now became an object of
terror to those who the moment before
had looked on him as an object of mirth.
The mighty lords of the creation, who
consider other animals as formed entirely
for <i>their pastime</i>, <i>their attire</i>, <i>their food</i>,
fled in crowds from one quadruped, and
would gladly have fallen on their knees
and worshipped him, like so many Egyptians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
adoring Apis, if by so doing they
could have hoped to deprecate the just
wrath of the incensed animal.—They
found safety at length, not in their own
courage or address, but in the superior
boldness and agility of other animals, who
were leagued with man against him. He
was surrounded by dogs, who attacked him
on all sides—he killed some outright, tossed
and wounded many more; but perceiving
his own strength diminishing, and
the number of his enemies increasing
every moment, he threw himself into the
sea, and there found a temporary protection
from the fury of his persecutors.—But the
dogs were instigated to follow; they at
length drove him from this last asylum;
and the poor, torn, bleeding, exhausted
animal was forced ashore, three or four
of the most furious of the dogs hanging
at different parts of his head and neck.
When they were removed, he raised his
honest countenance, and threw an indignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
look upon the rabble, as if to upbraid
them for such a return for his own labours,
and all the essential services which
his whole species render to mankind. Upon
my soul I felt the reproach. We could
not bear his looks, but sneaked away
without feeling much pride on account of
our near connection with those lords of the
creation, whom we had just beheld exerting
their prerogative.</p>

<p>We walked along a considerable time
without speaking. N—— broke silence at
last: “Well,” said he, “those amiable
creatures whom we have quitted, are
what they call human beings;—they
are more, they are Neapolitans, men
who are moved with the concord of
sweet sounds; from which I conclude
(Shakespear may say what he pleases), that
such men are as fit for treasons, stratagems,
and spoils, as those who never
heard softer melody than that of marrow-bones
and cleavers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“This fondness for barbarous amusements,”
said I, “cannot be stated exclusively
to the account of Neapolitans,
of English, or of any other particular
people. I am afraid the charge
lies against mankind in general; from
whatever motive it arises, a large proportion
of the individuals in all countries
have displayed a decided taste for
diversions which may be ranged in this
class.”</p>

<p>“It ought to be remembered, however,”
says T——, “that those fellows
with their dogs, who have been tormenting
the bull, are butchers, and the
lowest of the vulgar of this country;
whereas, among those who order fish to
be crimped, and pigs to be whipped
to death, as well as among those
who formerly attended Broughton’s
amphitheatre, and still attend cockpits,
will be found people of the first rank
in England.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pray,” said N——, addressing himself
to me, “did you ever see a cocagna?”</p>

<p>I acknowledged I never had.</p>

<p>“Then,” continued he, “I beg leave
to give you an idea of it. It is a Neapolitan
entertainment, relished by people
of the first rank in this polished country;
where the very vagrants in the street are
instructed in history, and the human
mind is refined by poetry, softened by
music, and elevated by religion. The
cocagna—Pray mark me—the cocagna
is an entertainment given to the people
four succeeding Sundays during the carnival.
Opposite to the palace, a kind of
wooden amphitheatre is erected. This
being covered with branches of trees,
bushes, and various plants, real and artificial,
has the appearance of a green
hill. On this hill are little buildings,
ornamented with pillars of loaves of
bread, with joints of meat, and dried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
fish, varnished, and curiously arranged
by way of capitals. Among the trees
and bushes are some oxen, a considerable
number of calves, sheep, hogs, and
lambs, all alive, and tied to posts. There
are, besides, a great number of living turkies,
geese, hens, pigeons, and other
fowls, nailed by the wings to the scaffolding.
Certain Heathen Deities appear
also occasionally upon this hill, but not
with a design to protect it, as you shall
see immediately. The guards are drawn
up in three ranks, to keep off the populace.
The Royal Family, with all
the nobility of the court, crowd the windows
and balconies of the palace, to enjoy
this magnificent sight. When his Majesty
waves his handkerchief, the guards
open to the right and left; the rabble
pour in from all quarters, and the entertainment
commences. You may easily
conceive what a delightful sight it must
be, to see several thousand hungry, half-naked
lazzaroni rush in like a torrent, destroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the whole fabric of loaves, fishes,
and joints of meat; overturn the Heathen
Deities, <i>for the honour of Christianity</i>;
pluck the fowls, at the expence
of their wings, from the posts to which
they were nailed; and, in the fury of their
struggling and fighting for their prey,
often tearing the miserable animals to
pieces, and sometimes stabbing each
other.”</p>

<p>“You ought, in candour, to add,” interrupted
Mr. T——, “that, though formerly
they were fixed to the posts
alive, yet of late the larger cattle have
been previously killed.”—“And pray,
my good Sir,” said N——, “will you
be so obliging as to inform me, what
crime the poor lambs and fowls have
committed, that they should be torn in
pieces alive?” “This piece of humanity,”
continued he, “recalls to my
memory a similar instance, in a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
ingenious gentleman, who proposed, as
the best and most effectual method of
sweeping chimnies, to place a large
goose at the top; and then, by a string
tied around her feet, to pull the animal
gently down to the hearth. The sagacious
projector asserted, that the goose,
being extremely averse to this method
of entering a house, would struggle
against it with all her might; and, during
this resistance, would move her wings
with such force and rapidity, as could
not fail to sweep the chimney completely.”
“Good God, Sir,” cried a
lady, who was present when this new method
was proposed, “How cruel would that
be to the poor goose!” “Why, Madam,”
replied the gentleman, “if you think my
method cruel to the goose, a couple of
ducks will do.”</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXIV">LETTER LXIV.</h2>

<p class="right">Naples.</p>

<p>On the first Sunday of May, we had
an opportunity of seeing the famous
Neapolitan miracle, of the liquefaction of
Saint Januarius’s blood, performed. This
Saint, you know, is the patron of Naples;
which circumstance alone forms a strong
presumption of his being a Saint of very
considerable power and efficacy; for it is
not to be imagined that the care of a city,
like Naples, which is threatened every
moment with destruction from Mount
Vesuvius, would be entrusted to an under-strapper.
Indeed there has, on some occasions,
been reason to fear, that, great and
powerful as this Saint is, the Dæmon of
the mountain would have got the better of
him; however, as Saint Januarius has been
able to protect them hitherto, and is supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
to be improved in the science of defence
by long practice, the Neapolitans
think it more prudent to abide by him than
to choose another; who, though he may
possibly be of higher rank, and older standing,
cannot have equal experience in this
particular kind of warfare.</p>

<p>Saint Januarius suffered martyrdom about
the end of the third century. When he
was beheaded, a pious lady of this city
caught about an ounce of his blood, which
has been carefully preserved in a bottle ever
since, without having lost a single grain of
its weight. This of itself, were it equally
demonstrable, might be considered as a
greater miracle than the circumstance on
which the Neapolitans lay the whole stress,
viz. that the blood which has congealed,
and acquired a solid form by age, is no
sooner brought near the head of the Saint,
than, as a mark of veneration, it immediately
liquefies. This experiment is made
three different times every year, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
considered by the Neapolitans as a miracle
of the first magnitude.</p>

<p>As the divinity of no other religion
whatever is any longer attempted to be
proved by fresh miracles, but all are now
trusted to their own internal evidence, and
to those wrought at a former period, this
miracle of Saint Januarius is probably the
more admired on account of its being the only
one, except transubstantiation, which remains
still in use, out of the vast abundance said
to have been performed at various periods
in support of the Roman Catholic faith.
The latter is unquestionably the greater
miracle, of the two; for to change a wafer
into flesh and blood, is more extraordinary
than to liquefy any substance whatever:
Yet I once imagined the liquefaction had
rather the advantage in this particular;
that the change is more obvious to the
senses. But I have lately been otherwise
instructed, by an ingenious person, who
was formerly a Jesuit. On somebody (not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
me, for I never do make objections in matters
of faith) having observed, That it was
unfortunate that the great change operated
on the wafer in transubstantiation, was not
visible, the person above alluded to pronounced
the miracle to be much greater on
that account. “For pray, Sir,” said he,
addressing himself to the objector, “suppose
I should immediately turn that fowl,
pointing to a turkey which was at that
moment stalking past; suppose I should
immediately turn that fowl into a woman,
would you not think it very extraordinary?”
“Certainly,” replied the
other. “Well, Sir, but after the change
is actually made, and the fowl has to all
intents and purposes become a woman,
if it still retained the appearance of a
turkey, you must acknowledge <i>that</i>
would be more extraordinary still. In
the same manner,” continued he, “in
the celebration of mass, the conversion
of the wafer into the real body and blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of Jesus Christ, is a great miracle, and
highly to be venerated; but, after this
wonderful change has actually taken
place, that the real body of Christ
should, even in the eyes of the sharpest
sighted spectators, still retain its original
form of a wafer, is a great deal
more amazing and stupendous.”</p>

<p>But, however great a superiority the miracle
of transubstantiation may have over that of
St. Januarius, in the opinion of Roman
Catholics in general, the Neapolitans imagine
the latter is sufficient to convert infidels,
and put heretics out of countenance.
A zealous believer of this country, having
described the miracle, breaks out into the
following exclamations: “O illustre memoria!
O verità irrefragabile! vengano
gli Heretici, vengano, e Stupiscano,
ed aprano gli occhi alla verità Cattolica,
et Evangelica; Bastarebbe questo sangue
di S. Gennaro sola à fare testimonia
della Fede. E possibile, che a tanto, et<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
si famoso miraculo non si converta tutta
la Gentilità, ed Infedeltà alla verità Cattolica
della Romana chiesa?” Though I
am not such an enthusiastic admirer of the
performance as this author, yet, on the
other hand, I do not think that Protestants,
however much they may be convinced it is
a trick, have any right to call it a <i>clumsy
trick</i>, without explaining in what it consists.
This is a liberty which some travellers
of great eminence have taken. Others
have asserted, that the substance in the
bottle, which is exhibited for the blood of
the Saint, is something naturally solid, but
which melts with a small degree of heat.
When it is first brought out of the cold
chapel, say those gentlemen, it is in its natural
solid state; but when brought before
the Saint by the priest, and rubbed between
his warm hands, and breathed upon for
some time, it melts; and this is the whole
mystery. Though I find myself unable to
explain on what principle the liquefaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
depends, I am fully convinced that it must
be something different from this; for I
have it from the most satisfactory authority,
from those who had opportunities of knowing,
and who believe no more in the miracle
than you do, that this congealed mass
has sometimes been found in a liquid state
in cold weather, before it was touched by
the Priest, or brought near the head of the
Saint; and that, on other occasions, it has
remained solid when brought before him,
notwithstanding all the efforts of the Priest
to melt it. When this happens, the superstitious,
which, at a very moderate calculation,
comprehends ninety-nine in a hundred
of the inhabitants of this city, are
thrown into the utmost consternation, and
are sometimes wrought up by their fears
into a state of mind which is highly dangerous
both to their civil and ecclesiastical
governors. It is true, that this happens but
seldom; for, in general, the substance in the
phial, whatever it may be, is in a solid
form in the chapel, and becomes liquid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
when brought before the Saint; but as this
is not always the case, it affords reason to
believe, that, whatever may have been the
case when this miracle or trick, call it which
you please, was first exhibited, the principle
on which it depends has somehow or
other been lost, and is not now understood
fully even by the Priests themselves; or
else they are not now so expert, as formerly,
in preparing the substance which represents
the Saint’s blood, so as to make it remain
solid when it ought, and liquefy the instant
it is required.</p>

<p>The head and blood of the Saint are
kept in a kind of press, with folding doors
of silver, in the chapel of St. Januarius, belonging
to the cathedral church. The real
head is probably not so fresh, and well
preserved, as the blood; and on that account
is not exposed to the eyes of the public, but
inclosed in a large silver bust, gilt and enriched
with jewels of high value. This
being what appears to the people, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
idea of the Saint’s features and complexion
are taken entirely from the bust.</p>

<p>The blood is kept in a small repository
by itself.</p>

<p>About mid-day, the bust, inclosing the
real head, was brought with great solemnity,
and placed under a kind of portico,
open on all sides, that the different communities,
which come in procession, may be
able to traverse it, and that the people may
have the comfort of beholding the miracle.
The processions of that solemn day were
innumerable; all the streets of Naples were
crowded with the various orders of ecclesiastics,
dressed in their richest robes. The
monks of each convent were mustered
under their own particular banners. A
splendid cross was carried before each procession;
and the images, in massy silver,
of the Saints, peculiarly patronising the
convents, followed the cross. In this order
they marched from the convents to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
pavilion, under which the head of St. Januarius
was placed, and having done due
obeisance to that great protector of this
city, they marched back by a different
route, in the same order, to their convent.
But as there are a great many convents in
Naples, and a great number of monks in
each convent, though the processions began
soon after mid-day, the evening was
well advanced before the last of them had
passed. The grand procession of all began
when the others had finished. It was composed
of a numerous body of clergy, and
an immense multitude of people of all ranks,
headed by the archbishop of Naples himself,
who carried the phial containing the
blood of the Saint. The D—— of H——
and I accompanied Sir W—— H—— to a
house directly opposite to the portico, where
the sacred head was placed. We there
found a large assembly of Neapolitan nobility.
A magnificent robe of velvet, richly
embroidered, was thrown over the shoulders
of the bust; a mitre, refulgent with jewels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
was placed on its head. The archbishop,
with a solemn pace, and a look full of awe
and veneration, approached, holding forth
the sacred phial which contained the precious
lump of blood. He addressed the
Saint in the humblest manner, fervently
praying that he would graciously condescend
to manifest his regard to his faithful
votaries the people of Naples, by the usual
token of ordering that lump of his sacred
blood to assume its natural and original
form. In those prayers he was joined by
the multitude around, particularly by the
women; of whom there seemed more than
their proportion. My curiosity prompted
me to leave the balcony, and mingle with
the multitude. I got by degrees quite near
the bust. Twenty minutes had already
elapsed, since the archbishop had been praying
with all possible earnestness, and turning
the phial around and around without
any effect. An old monk stood near the
archbishop, and was at the utmost pains to
instruct him how to handle, chafe, and rub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
the phial; he frequently took it into his
own hands, but his manœuvres were as
ineffectual as those of the archbishop. By
this time the people had become exceedingly
noisy; the women were quite hoarse with
praying; the monk continued his operations
with increased zeal; and the archbishop
was all over in a profuse sweat with
vexation. In whatever light the failure of
the miracle might appear to others, it was
a very serious matter to him; because the
people consider such an event as a proof of
the Saint’s displeasure, and a certain indication
that some dreadful calamity will ensue.
This was the first opportunity he had
had of officiating since his nomination to
the see. There was no knowing what fancy
might have entered into the heads of a superstitious
populace; they might have imagined,
or his enemies might have insinuated,
that the failure of the miracle proceeded
from St. Januarius’s disapprobation of the
person in whose hands it was to have taken
place. I never saw more evident marks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
vexation and alarm than appeared in the
countenance of the right reverend personage.
This alone would have convinced
me that they cannot command the liquefaction
when they please. While things were
in this state I observed a gentleman come
hastily through the crowd, and speak to the
old monk, who, in a pretty loud voice, and
with an accent and a grimace very expressive
of chagrin, replied, “Cospetto di
bacco è dura come una pietra.” At
the same time an acquaintance whispered
me, That it would be prudent to retire, because
the mob on similar occasions have
been struck with a notion, that the operation
of the miracle was disturbed by the
presence of heretics; on which they are
apt to insult them. I directly took his
hint, and joined the company I had left.
An universal gloom had overspread all their
countenances, they talked to each other in
whispers, and seemed oppressed with grief
and contrition. One very beautiful young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
lady cried and sobbed as if her heart
had been ready to break. The passions of
some of the rabble without doors took a
different turn; instead of sorrow, they were
filled with rage and indignation at the
Saint’s obstinacy. They put him in mind of
the zeal with which he was adored by
people of all ranks in Naples; of the honours
which had been conferred on
him; that he was respected here more
than in any other country on earth; and
some went so far as to call him, an old
ungrateful yellow-faced rascal, for his obduracy.
It was now almost dark—and
when least expected, the signal was given
that the miracle was performed.—The
populace filled the air with repeated shouts
of joy; a band of music began to play;
Te Deum was sung; couriers were dispatched
to the royal family, then at Portici,
with the glad tidings; the young
lady dried up her tears; the countenances
of our company brightened in an instant,
and they sat down to cards without farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
dread of eruptions, earthquakes, or
pestilence.</p>

<p>I had remarked, during their suspence
with respect to the success of the miracle,
that some imputed the delay partly to the
weather, which happened to be rainy, and
colder than is usual at this season; and
partly to the aukwardness of the Archbishop,
who, never having performed before,
was accused of not handling the phial
in the same dexterous and efficacious manner
that a person of experience would have
done. While they imputed the failure to
those causes, they seemed equally uneasy
with the rest of the company about the
consequences. It struck me that the first
sentiment was perfectly inconsistent with
the second. I mentioned this to a French
gentleman, who is here as travelling
companion to the young Comte de
G——. “If,” said I, “the weather, or
the unskilfulness of the Archbishop,
has prevented the substance in the phial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
from becoming liquid, this surely cannot
be an indication that Heaven or the
Saint is displeased; if, on the contrary,
the blood continuing solid in the presence
of the Saint, proceeds from Heaven
or the Saint being offended, then no
kind of weather, and no kind of expertness
on the part of the Archbishop,
could have rendered it liquid.”—“Monsieur,”
said he, “voilà ce qu’on
appelle raisonner, ce que ces messieurs ne
font jamais.”</p>

<p>The same evening, an acquaintance
of mine, who is also a Roman Catholic,
and who remained close by the Archbishop
till all was over, assured me, that
the miracle had failed entirely; for the
old monk seeing no symptom of the
blood liquefying, had called out that the
miracle had succeeded; on which the signal
had been given, the people had shouted,
the Archbishop had held up the bottle,
moving it with a rapid motion before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
eyes of the spectators, and nobody chusing
to contradict what every body wished, he had
been allowed to cover up the phial, and carry
it back to the Chapel, with the contents, in
the same form they had come abroad. How
far this account is exactly true, I will not
take on me to assert; I was not near
enough to see the transaction myself, and
I have only the authority of this person,
having heard no other body say they had
observed the same.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXV">LETTER LXV.</h2>

<p class="right">Naples.</p>

<p>The tomb of Virgil is on the mountain
of Pausilippo, a little above
the grotto of that name; you ascend to it
by a narrow path which runs through a
vineyard; it is overgrown with ivy leaves
and shaded with branches, shrubs, and
bushes; an ancient bay-tree, with infinite
propriety, overhangs it. Many a solitary
walk have I taken to this place. The
earth, which contains his ashes, we expect
to find clothed in the brightest verdure.
Viewed from the magic spot, the objects
which adorn the bay become doubly interesting.
The Poet’s verses are here recollected
with additional pleasure; the verses of
Virgil are interwoven in our minds with
a thousand interesting ideas, with the memory
of our boyish years, or the sportive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
scenes of childhood, of our earliest friends
and companions, many of whom are now
dead; and those who still live, and for
whom we retain the first impression of affection,
are at such a distance as renders
the hopes of seeing them again very uncertain.
No wonder, therefore, when in
a contemplative mood, that our steps are
often directed to a spot so well calculated
to create and cherish sentiments congenial
with the state of our mind. But then
comes an antiquarian, who, with his odious
doubts, disturbs the pleasing source of
our enjoyment; and from the fair and delightful
fields of fancy, conveys us in a
moment to a dark, barren, and comfortless
desert;—he <i>doubts</i>, whether this be
the real place where the ashes of Virgil
were deposited; and tells us an unsatisfactory
story about the other side of the
bay, and that he is rather inclined to believe
that the Poet was buried somewhere
there, without fixing on any particular
spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>Would to heaven those doubters would
keep their minds to themselves, and not
ruffle the tranquillity of believers!</p>

<p>But, after all, why should not this be
the real tomb of Virgil? Why should the
enthusiasts, who delight in pilgrimages to
this spot, be deprived of that pleasure?
Why should the Poet’s ghost be allowed to
wander along the dreary banks of Styx,
till the antiquarians erect a cenotaph in
his honour? Even they acknowledge that
he was buried on this bay, and near Naples;
and tradition has fixed on this spot,
which, exclusive of other presumptions,
is a much stronger evidence in its favour
than their vague conjectures against it.</p>

<p>In your way to the classic fields of Baia
and Cumæ, you pass through the grotto of
Pausilippo, a subterraneous passage through
the mountain, near a mile in length,
about twenty feet in breadth, and thirty
or forty in height, every where, except at
the two extremities, where it is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
higher. People of fashion generally drive
through this passage with torches, but
the country people and foot passengers
find their way without much difficulty by
the light which enters at the extremities,
and at two holes pierced through the
mountain near the middle of the grotto,
which admit light from above.</p>

<p>Mr. Addison tells us, that the common
people of Naples in his time believed that
this passage through the mountain was
the work of magic, and that Virgil was
the magician. But this is the age of
scepticism; and the common people, in
imitation of people of fashion, begin to
harbour doubts concerning all their old
established opinions. A Neapolitan Valet-de-place
asked an English gentleman
lately, Whether Signior Virgilio, of whom
he had heard so much, had really, and
bona fide, been a magician or not? “A
magician,” replied the Englishman;
“ay, that he was, and a very great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
magician too.” “And do you,” resumed
the Valet, “believe it was he who
pierced this rock?” “As for this particular
rock,” answered the Master, “I
will not swear to it from my own knowledge,
because it was done before I was
born; but I am ready to make oath, that
I have known him pierce, and even melt,
some very obdurate substances.”</p>

<p>Two miles beyond the Grotta di Pausilippe,
is a circular lake, about half a mile
in diameter, called Lago d’Agnano; on
whose margin is situated the famous Grotta
del Cane, where so many dogs have been
tortured and suffocated, to shew the effect
of a vapour which rises about a foot above
the bottom of this little cave, and is destructive
of animal life. A dog having his head
held in this vapour, is convulsed in a few
minutes, and soon after falls to the earth
motionless. This experiment is repeated
for the amusement of every unfeeling person,
who has half a crown in his pocket,
and affects a turn for natural philosophy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
The experiment is commonly made on
dogs; because they, of all animals, show
the greatest affection for man, and prefer
his company to that of their own species,
or of any other living creature. The fellows
who attend at this cave have always
some miserable dogs, with ropes about their
necks, ready for this cruel purpose. If the
poor animals were unconscious of what
was to happen, it would be less affecting;
but they struggle to get free, and show
every symptom of horror when they are
dragged to this cave of torment. I should
have been happy to have taken the effect
of the vapour for granted, without a new
trial; but some of the company were of a
more philosophical turn of mind than I
have any pretensions to. When the unhappy
animal found all his efforts to escape
were ineffectual, he seemed to plead for
mercy by the dumb eloquence of looks,
and the blandishments natural to his species.
While he licked the hand of his
keeper, the unrelenting wretch dashed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
a blow, and thrust his head into the murderous
vapour.</p>

<p>When the real utility of the knowledge
acquired by cruel experiments on animals
(a practice which has been carried to dreadful
lengths of late) is fairly stated, and
compared with the exquisiteness of <i>their</i>
sufferings, the benefit resulting to mankind
from thence will seem too dearly bought
in the eyes of a person of humanity. Humanity!
If language had belonged to other
animals besides man, might not they have
chosen that word to express—cruelty? if
they had, thank God, they would have
done injustice to many of the human race.
I have left the poor dog too long in the
vapour; much longer than he remained in
reality. The D—— of H——, shocked at
the fellow’s barbarity, wrested the dog from
his hands, bore him to the open air, and
gave him life and liberty; which he seemed
to enjoy with all the bounding rapture of
gladness and gratitude. If you should ever
come this way, pray do not insist on seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
the experiment; it is not worth while; the
thing is ascertained; it is beyond a doubt
that this vapour convulses and kills every
breathing animal.</p>

<p>You come next to the favourite fields of
fancy and poetical fiction. The Campi
Phlegrei, where Jupiter overcame the giants;
the solfaterra still smoking, as if
from the effects of his thunder; the Monte
Nova, which was thrown suddenly from
the bowels of the earth, as if the sons of
Titan had intended to renew the war; the
Monte Barbaro, formerly Mons Gaurus,
the favourite of Bacchus; the grotto of the
Cumæan Sibyl; the noxious and gloomy
lakes of Avernus and Acheron; and the
green bowers of Elysium.</p>

<p>The town of Puzzoli, and its environs,
present such a number of objects, worthy
of the attention of the antiquarian, the natural
philosopher, and the classic scholar,
that to describe all with the minuteness
they deserve, would fill volumes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The Temple of Jupiter Serapis at Puzzoli,
is accounted a very interesting monument
of antiquity; being quite different
from the Roman and Greek temples, and
built in the manner of the Asiatics, probably
by the Egyptian and Asiatic merchants
settled at Puzzoli, which was the
great emporium of Italy, until the Romans
built Ostia and Antium.</p>

<p>Sylla having abdicated the Dictatorship,
retired, and passed the remainder of his
life in this city.</p>

<p>The ruins of Cicero’s villa, near this
city, are of such extent, as to give a high
idea of the wealth of this great orator.
Had Fortune always bestowed her gifts
with so much propriety, she never would
have been accused of blindness. When the
truly great are blessed with riches, it affords
pleasure to every candid mind. Neither
this villa near Puzzoli, that at Tusculum,
nor any of his other country-seats, were the
scenes of idleness or riot. They are distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
by the names of the works he composed
there; works which have always
been the delight of the learned, and which,
still more than the important services he
rendered his country when in office, have
contributed to immortalize his name.</p>

<p>The bay between Puzzoli and Baia is
about a league in breadth. In crossing this
in a boat, you see the ruins called Ponte di
Caligula, from their being thought the remains
of a bridge which Caligula attempted
to build across. They are by others, with
more probability, thought to be the ruins
of a mole built with arches. Having passed
over this gulph, a new field of curiosities
presents itself. The baths and prisons of
Nero, the tomb of Agrippina, the temples
of Venus, of Diana, and of Mercury, and
the ruins of the ancient city of Cumæ; but
no vestiges now remain of many of those
magnificent villas which adorned this luxurious
coast, nor even of the town of Baia.
The whole of this beauteous bay, formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the seat of pleasure, and, at one period, the
most populous spot in Italy, is now very
thinly inhabited; and the contrast is still
stronger between the antient opulence and
present poverty, than between the numbers
of its antient and present inhabitants. It
must be acknowledged, that we can hardly
look around us, in any part of this world,
without perceiving objects which, to a contemplative
mind, convey reflections on the
instability of grandeur, and the sad vicissitudes
and reverses to which human affairs
are liable; but <i>here</i> those objects are so
numerous, and so striking, that they must
make an impression on the most careless
passenger.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXVI">LETTER LXVI.</h2>

<p class="right">Naples.</p>

<p>As the Court are not at present at
Casserta, we have not seen that place
in all its splendour; we passed, however,
one very agreeable day there, with Lady
H—— and S—H—— F——n.</p>

<p>The palace at Casserta was begun in the
year 1750, after a plan of Vanvitelli; the
work is now carried on under the direction
of his son. While the present King of
Spain remained at Naples, there were generally
about two thousand workmen employed;
at present there are about five hundred.
It will be finished in a few years, and
will then, unquestionably, be one of the most
spacious and magnificent palaces in Europe.
It has been said, that London is too large a
capital for the island of Great Britain; and
it has been compared to a turgid head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
placed on an emaciated body. The palace
of Casserta also seems out of proportion
with the revenues of this kingdom. It is
not, properly speaking, a head too large
for the body; but rather an ornament, by
much too expensive and bulky for either
head or body. This palace is situated about
sixteen miles north from Naples, on the
plain where ancient Capua stood. It was
thought prudent to found a building, on
which such sums of money were to be lavished,
at a considerable distance from
Mount Vesuvius. It were to be wished,
that the contents of the cabinet at Portici
were removed from the same dangerous
neighbourhood. That he might not be limited
in ground for the gardens, may have
been his Spanish Majesty’s motive for
choosing that his palace should be at a
distance from Naples; and that it might
not be exposed to insult from an enemy’s
fleet, was probably the reason that determined
him to place it at a distance from the
sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>This immense building is of a rectangular
form, seven hundred and fifty feet
English, by five hundred and eighty;
about one hundred and twelve feet high,
comprehending five habitable stories, which
contain such a number of apartments as
will accommodate the most numerous
court, without any accessary buildings.</p>

<p>The rectangle is divided into four courts,
each of about two hundred and fifty-two feet
by one hundred and seventy. In each of
the two principal fronts, are three corresponding
gates, forming three openings,
which pierce the whole building. The
middle gate forms the entry to a magnificent
portico, through which the coaches
drive. In the middle of this, and in the
centre of the edifice, there is a vestibule
of an octogonal form, which opens into
the four grand courts at four sides of the
octogon; two other sides open into the
portico, one to the staircase; and, at the
eighth side, there is a statue of Hercules,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
crowned by Victory, with this inscription,</p>

<p class="center">VIRTUS POST FORTIA FACTA CORONAT.</p>

<p>The grand staircase is adorned with the
richest marble; the upper vestibule to
which you ascend by this noble stair, is an
octogon also, and surrounded by twenty-four
pillars of yellow marble, each of
which is of one piece of eighteen feet
high, without including the pedestal or
capital. From this upper vestibule there
are entries into—But I have a notion
you are tired of this description, which I
assure you is likewise my case. I beg,
therefore, you may take it for granted,
that the apartments within, particularly
their Majesties, and that destined for balls
and theatrical entertainments, correspond
with the magnificence of the external appearance.</p>

<p>Among the workmen employed in finishing
this palace and the gardens, there
are one hundred and fifty Africans; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
as the King of Naples is constantly at war
with the Barbary States, he always has a
number of their sailors prisoners, all of
whom are immediately employed as slaves
in the gallies, or at some public work.
There are at present at Casserta, about the
same number of Christian slaves; all of
these have been condemned to this servitude
for some crime, some of them for the
greatest of all crimes; they are, however,
better clothed and fed than the Africans.
This is done, no doubt, in honour of the
Christian religion, and to demonstrate that
Christians, even after they have been
found guilty of the blackest crimes, are
worthier men, and more deserving of lenity,
than Mahometan prisoners, however
innocent they may be in all <i>other</i> respects.</p>

<p>The gardens belonging to this palace
are equally extensive and magnificent. A
great number of fine statues, most of
them copies of the best antique, are kept
in a storehouse till the gardens are finished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
when they will be placed in them.
The largest and finest elephant I ever saw
is here at present; he is kept by African
slaves: they seem to know how to manage
him perfectly; he is well thriven, and
goes through a number of tricks and evolutions
with much docility and judgment.</p>

<p>In the garden, there is an artificial water
and island. This, if one may venture to
say so, seems a little injudicious; it brings
to our memory the bay of Naples, with
its islands, a recollection by no means
favourable to this royal contrivance. In
this island there is a kind of a castle, regularly
fortified, with a ditch around
it, and ramparts, bastions, sally-ports,
&amp;c. &amp;c. and a numerous train of artillery,
some of them nine or ten <i>ouncers</i>. I no
sooner entered this fort, than I wished that
Uncle Toby and Corporal Trim had been of
our party; it would have charmed the
soul of the worthy veteran and his faithful
servant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>I asked the man who attended us,
What he imagined this fortification was
intended for?—Sir H—— F—— said,
“The cannon were certainly designed
against the frogs, who were continually
attempting to scale the ramparts from
the ditch.”—I asked again, What
was the real design of erecting this fort?
The man answered, stretching out his
arms, and making as wide a circle with
them as he could, “Tutto, tutto per il
sollazo del Re.” “Yes,” said I, “it is
surely in the highest degree reasonable,
that not only this fort, but the
whole kingdom, should be appropriated
to the amusement of his Majesty.”—“Certo,”
replied the man. I wished to
see how far the fellow’s liberality would go—“Not
only this kingdom,” continued
I, “but all Europe would be highly honoured
in contributing to the amusement
of his Majesty.” “Certo, certo,” said
the man.</p>

<p class="right">Naples.</p>

<p>The King and Queen lately paid a
visit to four of the principal nunneries
in this town. Their motive was, to
gratify the curiosity of the Archduchess,
and her husband, Prince Albert of Saxony.
I ought to have informed you, that
this illustrious couple left Vienna some
months after us, with an intention to make
the tour of Italy. We had the honour
of seeing them frequently while at Rome,
where they conciliated the affections of
the Italian nobles by their obliging manners,
as much as they commanded respect
by their high rank. The Archduchess is
a very beautiful woman, and more distinguished
by the propriety of her conduct,
than by either birth or beauty. As white,
by the link of contrast, is connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the idea of black; so this amiable Duchess
sometimes recals those to people’s memories,
whose ideas of dignity are strongly
contrasted with hers. Conscious, from
her infancy, of the highest rank, and
accustomed to honours, it never enters
into her thoughts that any person will
fail in paying her a due respect; while
they, eternally jealous that enough of respect
is not paid them, give themselves
airs which would be intolerable in an
Empress. A smile of benignity puts all
who approach this Princess perfectly at
their ease, and dignity sits as smoothly on
her as a well-made garment; while, on
them, it bristles out like the quills of a
porcupine, or the feathers of an enraged
turkey-cock.</p>

<p>As nobody is permitted to enter those
convents, except on such extraordinary
occasions as this, when they are visited
by the Sovereigns, the British Minister
seized this opportunity of procuring an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
order for admitting the D—— of H—— and
me. We accordingly accompanied him, and
a few others, who were in the King’s
suite. I have seen various nunneries in
different parts of Europe, but none that
could be compared even with the meanest
of those four in this city, for neatness
and conveniency. Each of them is provided
with a beautiful garden; and the
situation of one is the happiest that can
be imagined, commanding a prospect
nearly as extensive as that from the Carthusian
convent near the castle of St.
Elmo. Those four nunneries are for the
reception of young ladies of good families;
and, into one in particular, none
but such as are of very high rank can
be admitted, either as pensioners, or to
take the veil. Each of the young ladies
in this splendid convent, have both a summer
and a winter apartment, and many
other accommodations unknown in other
retreats of this nature. The royal visitors
were received in all of them by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
Lady Abbess, at the head of the oldest of
the sisterhood; they were afterwards presented
with nosegays, and served with
fruit, sweetmeats, and a variety of cooling
drinks, by the younger nuns. The Queen
and her amiable sister received all very
graciously; conversing familiarly with the
Lady Abbesses, and asking a few obliging
questions of each.</p>

<p>In one convent the company were surprised,
on being led into a large parlour, to
find a table covered, and every appearance
of a most plentiful cold repast, consisting
of several joints of meat, hams, fowl, fish,
and various other dishes. It seemed rather
ill-judged to have prepared a feast of such
a solid nature immediately after dinner;
for those royal visits were made in the afternoon.
The Lady Abbess, however,
earnestly pressed their Majesties to sit down,
with which they complied, and their example
was followed by the Archduchess and
some of the ladies; the nuns stood behind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
to serve their Royal guests. The Queen
chose a slice of cold turkey, which, on
being cut up, turned out a large piece of
lemon ice, of the shape and appearance of
a roasted turkey. All the other dishes were
ices of various kinds, disguised under the
forms of joints of meat, fish, and fowl, as
above mentioned. The gaiety and good
humour of the King, the affable and engaging
behaviour of the Royal sisters, and
the satisfaction which beamed from the
plump countenance of the Lady Abbess,
threw an air of cheerfulness on this scene;
which was interrupted, however, by gleams
of melancholy reflection, which failed not
to dart across the mind, at sight of so
many victims to the pride of family, to
avarice, and superstition. Many of those
victims were in the full bloom of health
and youth, and some of them were remarkably
handsome. There is something in a
nun’s dress which renders the beauty of a
young woman more interesting than is in
the power of the gayest, richest, and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
laboured ornaments. This certainly does
not proceed from any thing remarkably
becoming in black and white flannel. The
Lady Abbess and the elderly nuns made no
more impression in their vestal robes, than
those stale, forlorn dames, whom you may
see displaying their family jewels and shrivelled
countenances every night at Ranelagh
or in the side-boxes. The interest you take
in a beautiful woman is heightened on seeing
her in the dress of a nun, by the opposition
which you imagine exists between
the life to which her rash vows have condemned
her, and that to which her own
unbiassed inclination would have led her.
You are moved with pity, which you know
is a-kin to love, on seeing a young blooming
creature doomed to retirement and self-denial,
who was formed by nature for society
and enjoyment.</p>

<p>If we may credit the ancient poets, those
young women who are confined to a cloister
life on any part of this coast, are more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
to be pitied than they would be under the
same restraint elsewhere. They tell us,
the very air in this part of Italy is repugnant
to that kind of constitution, and that
turn of mind, of which it would be peculiarly
happy for nuns to be possessed. Propertius
intreats his Cynthia not to remain
too long on a shore which he seems to
think dangerous to the chastest maiden.</p>

<p class="noindent">Martial asserts, that a woman who came

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Penelope venit, abit Helene.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">I have certainly met with ladies, after they
had resided some time at Naples, who, in
point of character and constitution, were
thought to have a much stronger resemblance
to Helen than to Penelope; but as
I have no great faith in the sudden operation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
of physical causes in matters of this
kind, I never doubted of those ladies having
carried the same disposition to Naples that
they brought from it. Though there are
not wanting those who affirm, that the influence
of this seducing climate is evident
<i>now</i> in as strong a degree as it is described
to have been anciently; that it pervades
people of all ranks and conditions, and that
in the convents themselves;</p>

<div class="verse">Even there where frozen chastity retires,</div>
<div class="verse">Love finds an altar for forbidden fires.</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Others, who carry their researches still
deeper, and pretend to have a distinct
knowledge of the effect of aliment through
all its changes on the human constitution,
think, that the amorous disposition, imputed
to Neapolitans, is only in part owing
to their voluptuous climate, but in a far
greater degree to the hot, sulphureous nature
of their soil, which those profound naturalists
declare communicates its fiery qualities
to the juices of vegetables; thence
they are conveyed to the animals who feed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
on them, and particularly to man, whose
nourishment consisting both of animal and
vegetable food, he must have in his veins
a double dose of the stimulating particles
in question. No wonder, therefore, say
those nice investigators of cause and effect,
that the inhabitants of this country are
more given to amorous indulgencies, than
those who are favoured with a chaster soil
and a colder climate.</p>

<p>For my own part, I must acknowledge,
that I have seen nothing, since I came to
Naples, to justify the general imputations
above mentioned, or to support this very
ingenious theory. On the contrary, there
are circumstances from which the opposers
of this system draw very different conclusions;
for every system of philosophy, like
every Minister of Great Britain, has an opposition.
The gentlemen in opposition to
the voluptuous influence of this climate,
and the fiery effects of this soil, undermine
the foundation of their antagonists’ theory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
by asserting, that, so far from being of a
warmer complexion than their neighbours,
the Neapolitans are of colder constitutions,
or more philosophic in the command of
their passions, than any people in Europe.
Do not the lower class of men, say they,
strip themselves before the houses which
front the bay, and bathe in the sea without
the smallest ceremony? Are not numbers
of those stout, athletic figures, during
the heat of the day, seen walking and
sporting on the shore perfectly naked; and
with no more idea of shame, than Adam
felt in his state of innocence; while the ladies
from their coaches, and the servant-maids
and young girls, who pass along,
contemplate this singular spectacle with as
little apparent emotion as the ladies in
Hyde Park behold a review of the horse-guards?</p>

<p>As Sir W—— and L——y H—— are

<p>We delayed visiting Tivoli, Frescati,
and Albano, till our return from
Naples.</p>

<p>The Campagna is an uninhabited plain,
surrounding the city of Rome, bounded on
one side by the sea, and on the other by an
amphitheatre of hills, crowned with towns,
villages, and villas, which form the finest
landscapes that can be imagined. The ancient
Romans were wont to seek shelter
from the scorching heats of summer, among
the woods and lakes of those hills; and the
Cardinals and Roman Princes, at the same
season, retire to their villas; while many
of the wealthier sort of citizens take lodgings
in the villages, during the season of
gathering the vines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>On the road from Rome to Tivoli, about
three miles from the latter, strangers are
desired to visit a kind of lake called Solfatara
formerly Lakus Albulus, and there
shown certain substances, to which they give
the name of Floating Islands. They are nothing
else than bunches of bullrushes,
springing from a thin soil, formed by dust
and sand blown from the adjacent ground,
and glued together by the bitumen which
swims on the surface of this lake, and the
sulphur with which its waters are impregnated.
Some of these islands are twelve or
fifteen yards in length; the soil is sufficiently
strong to bear five or six people,
who, by the means of a pole, may move
to different parts of the lake, as if they
were in a boat. This lake empties itself,
by a whitish, muddy stream, into the Teverone,
the ancient Anio; a vapour, of a
sulphureous smell, arising from it as it
flows. The ground near this rivulet, as also
around the borders of the lake, resounds,
as if it were hollow, when a horse gallops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
over it. The water of this lake has the
singular quality of covering every substance
which it touches with a hard, white, stoney
matter. On throwing a bundle of small
sticks or shrubs into it, they will, in a few
days, be covered with a white crust; but,
what seems still more extraordinary, this
encrustating quality is not so strong in the
lake itself, as in the canal, or little rivulet
that runs from it; and the farther the water
has flowed from the lake, till it is quite
lost in the Anio, the stronger this quality
is. Those small, round encrustations,
which cover the sand and pebbles, resembling
sugar-plums, are called Confetti di
Tivoli. Fishes are found in the Anio, both
above and below Tivoli, till it receives the
Albula; after which, during the rest of
its course to the Tiber, there are none.
The waters of this lake had a high medical
reputation anciently, but they are in no
esteem at present.</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the eminence on
which Tivoli stands, are the ruins of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
vast and magnificent villa built by the emperor
Adrian. In this were comprehended
an amphitheatre, several temples, a library,
a circus, a naumachia. The emperor also
gave to the buildings and gardens of this
famous villa the names of the most celebrated
places; as the Academia, the Lycæum,
the Prytaneum of Athens, the
Tempe of Thessaly, and the Elysian fields
and infernal regions of the poets. There
were also commodious apartments for a vast
number of guests, all admirably distributed
with baths, and every conveniency. Every
quarter of the world contributed to ornament
this famous villa, whose spoils have
since formed the principal ornaments of the
Campidoglio, the Vatican, and the palaces
of the Roman Princes. It is said to have
been three miles in length, and above a
mile in breadth. Some antiquarians make
it much larger; but the ruins, now remaining,
do not mark a surface of a quarter
of that extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>At no great distance, they shew the place
to which the Eastern Queen Zenobia was
confined, after she was brought in triumph
to Rome by the emperor Aurelian.</p>

<p>The town of Tivoli is now wretchedly
poor; it boasts however greater antiquity
than Rome itself, being the ancient Tibur,
which, Horace informs us, was founded by
a Grecian colony.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This was a populous and flourishing town
in remoter antiquity; but it appears to have
been thinly inhabited in the reign of Augustus.
Horace, in an Epistle to Mæcenas,
says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Parvum parva decent. Mihi jam non Regia Roma,</div>
<div class="verse">Sed <i>vacuum Tibur</i> placet——</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Though the town itself was not populous,
the beauty of the situation, and wholesomeness
of the air, prompted great numbers
of illustrious Romans, both before the
final destruction of the Republic, and afterwards
in Augustus’s time, to build country-houses
in the neighbourhood. Julius Cæsar
had a villa here, which he was under
the necessity of selling to defray the expence
of the public shews and games he exhibited
to the people during his Ædileship. Plutarch
says, that his liberality and magnificence,
on this occasion, obscured the glory
of all who had preceded him in the office,
and gained the hearts of the people to such
a degree, that they were ready to invent
new offices and new honours for him. He
then laid the foundation of that power
and popularity, which enabled him, in the
end, to overturn the constitution of his
country. Caius Cassius had also a country
house here; where Marcus Brutus and he
are said to have had frequent meetings, and
to have formed the plan which terminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the ambition of Cæsar, and again offered to
Rome that freedom which she had not the
virtue to accept. Here, also, was the villa
of Augustus, whose success in life arose
at the field of Philippi from which he
fled, was confirmed by the death of the
most virtuous citizens of Rome, and who,
without the talents, reaped the fruits of
the labours and vast projects of Julius.
Lepidus the Triumvir, Cæcilius Metellus,
Quintilius Varus, the poets Catullus and
Propertius, and other distinguished Romans,
had villas in this town or its environs;
and you are shewn the spots on which
they stood; but nothing renders Tibur so
interesting, as the frequent mention which
Horace makes of it in his writings. His
great patron and friend Mæcenas had a
villa here, the ruins of which are to be
seen on the south bank of the Anio; and
it was pretty generally supposed, that
the poet’s own house and farm were very
near it, and immediately without the walls
of Tibur; but it has been of late asserted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
with great probability, that Horace’s farm
was situated nine miles above that of Mæcenas’s,
at the side of a stream called Licenza,
formerly Digentia, near the hill Lucretilis,
in the country of the ancient Sabines.
Those who hold this opinion say, that
when Horace talks of Tibur, he alludes to
the villa of Mæcenas; but when he mentions
Digentia, or Lucretilis, his own house
and farm are to be understood; as in the
eighteenth Epistle of the first book,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Me quoties resicit gelidus Digentia rivus,</div>
<div class="verse">Quem Mandela bibit, rugosus frigore pagus;</div>
<div class="verse">Quid sentire putas, quid credis, amice, precari?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the seventeenth Ode of the first book,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Velox amænum sæpe Lucretilem</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Mutat Lycæo Faunus;——</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and in other passages. But whether the
poet’s house and farm were near the town
of Tibur, or at a distance from it, his writings
sufficiently show that he spent much of
his time there; and it is probable that he
composed great part of his works in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
favourite retreat. This he himself in some
measure declares, in that fine Ode addressed
to Julius Antonius, son of Mark Antony,
by Fulvia; the same whom Augustus first
pardoned, and afterwards put privately to
death, on account of an intrigue into which
Antonius was seduced by the abandoned
Julia, daughter of Augustus.</p>

<p>If you ever come to Tivoli, let it not be
with a numerous party; come alone, or
with a single friend, and be sure to put
your Horace in your pocket. You will
read him here with more enthusiasm than
elsewhere; you will imagine you see the
philosophic poet wandering among the
groves, sometimes calmly meditating his
moral precepts, and sometimes <i>his eye in a
fine frenzy</i> rolling with all the fire of poetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
enthusiasm. If Tivoli had nothing
else to recommend it but its being so often
sung by the most elegant of the poets, and
its having been the residence of so many
illustrious men, these circumstances alone
would render it worthy the attention of
travellers; but it will also be interesting to
many on account of its cascade, the Sibyl’s
Temple, and the Villa Estense.</p>

<p>The river Anio, deriving its source from
a part of the Apennines, fifty miles above
Tivoli, glides through a plain till it comes
near that town, when it is confined for a
short space between two hills, covered with
groves. These were supposed to have been
the residence of the Sibyl Albunea, to whom
the temple was dedicated. The river, moving
with augmented rapidity as its channel
is confined, at length rushes headlong
over a lofty precipice; the noise of its fall
resounds through the hills and groves of
Tivoli; a liquid cloud arises from the
foaming water, which afterwards divides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
into numberless small cascades, waters several
orchards, and, having gained the
plain, flows quietly for the rest of its course,
till it loses itself in the Tiber. It is not
surprising that the following lines have
been so often quoted by those who visit the
Sibyl’s Temple, because they delineate, in
the most expressive manner, some of the
principal features of the country around it,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Me nec tam patiens Lacedæmon,</div>
<div class="verse">Nec tam Larissæ percussit campus opimæ,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Quam domus Albuneæ resonantis,</div>
<div class="verse">Et præceps Anio, et Tiburni lucus, et uda</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Mobilibus pomaria rivis.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The elegant and graceful form of the beautiful
little temple I have so often mentioned,
indicates its having been built when the arts
were in the highest state of perfection at
Rome. Its proportions are not more happy
than its situation, on a point of the mountain
fronting the great cascade.</p>

<p>Before they take their leave of Tivoli,
strangers usually visit the Villa Estense,
belonging to the Duke of Modena. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
built by Hippolitus of Este, Cardinal of
Ferrara, and brother to the duke of that
name; but more distinguished by being the
person to whom Ariosto addressed his Poem
of Orlando Furioso. The house itself is not
in the finest style of architecture. There
are many whimsical waterworks in the
gardens. Those who do not approve of the
taste of their construction, still owe them
some degree of respect, on account of their
being the first grand waterworks in Europe;
much more ancient than those of Versailles.
The situation is noble, the terraces lofty,
the trees large and venerable; and though
the ground is not laid out to the greatest
advantage, yet the whole has a striking air
of magnificence and grandeur.</p>

<p>Frescati is an agreeable village,
on the declivity of a hill, about
twelve miles from Rome. It derives its
name from the coolness of the air, and
<i>fresh</i> verdure of the fields around. It is a
bishop’s see, and always possessed by one of
the six eldest Cardinals. At present it belongs
to the Cardinal Duke of York, who,
whether in the country or at Rome, passes
the greatest part of his time in the duties
and ceremonies of a religion, of whose
truth he seems to have the fullest conviction;
and who, living himself in great
simplicity, and not in the usual style of
Cardinals, spends a large proportion of his
revenue in acts of charity and benevolence;
<i>the world forgetting, by the world forgot</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
except by those who enjoy the comforts of
life through his bounty.</p>

<p>Tivoli was the favourite residence of the
ancient Romans. The moderns give the
preference to Frescati, in whose neighbourhood
some of the most magnificent villas in
Italy are situated.</p>

<p>The villa Aldobrandini, called also Belvedere,
is the most remarkable, on account
of its fine situation, extensive gardens, airy
terraces, its grottos, cascades, and waterworks.
Over a saloon, near the grand
cascade, is the following inscription:</p>

<p class="center">HUC EGO MIGRAVI MUSIS COMITATUS APOLLO,<br />
HIC DELPHI, HIC HELICON, HIC MIHI DELOS ERIT.</p>

<p>The walls are adorned with a representation
of Apollo and the Muses; and some
of that God’s adventures are painted in
Fresco by Domenichino, particularly the
manner in which he treated Marsyas.
This, in my humble opinion, had better
been omitted; both because it is a disagreeable
subject for a picture, and because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
does no honour to Apollo. Marsyas unquestionably
was an object of contempt
and ridicule, on account of his presumption;
but the punishment said to have been
inflicted on him exceeds all bounds, and
renders the inflictor more detestable in our
eyes than the insolent satyr himself. This
story is so very much out of character,
and so unlike the elegant god of poetry
and music, that I am inclined to suspect
it is not true. There is a report,
equally incredible, which has been propagated
by malicious people concerning his
sister Diana; I do not mean her rencounter
with Actæon, for the Goddess of Chastity
may, without inconsistency, be supposed
cruel, but it is quite impossible to reconcile
her general character with the stories
of her nocturnal visits to Endymion.</p>

<p>The villa Ludovisi is remarkable for its
gardens and waterworks. The hills on
which Frescati is situated, afford great
abundance of water, a circumstance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
which the owners of those villas have profited,
all of them being ornamented with
fountains, cascades, or waterworks of
some kind or other.</p>

<p>The villa Taverna, belonging to the
Prince Borghese, is one of the finest and
best furnished of any in the neighbourhood
of Rome. From this you ascend
through gardens to Monte Dracone, another
palace on a more lofty situation, belonging
also to that Prince, and deriving
its name from the arms of his family.
The ancient city of Tusculum is supposed
to have stood on the spot, or very near it,
where Frescati now is built; and at the
distance of about a mile and a half, it is
generally believed, was the Tusculan villa
of Cicero, at a place now called Grotta
Ferrata. Some Greek monks of the order
of St. Basil, flying from the persecution
of the Saracens in the eleventh century, were
permitted to build a convent on the ruins
of Cicero’s famous house. They still perform
the service in the Greek language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Whichever way you walk from Frescati,
you have the most delightful scenes
before you. I passed two very agreeable
days, wandering through the gardens and
from villa to villa. The pleasure of our
party was not a little augmented by the
observations of Mr. B——, a lively old
gentleman from Scotland, a man of worth
but no antiquarian, and indeed no admirer
of any thing, ancient or modern, which
has not some relation to his native country;
but to ballance that indifference, he feels
the warmest regard for every thing which
has. We extended our walks as far as
the lake of Nemi, a bason of water lying
in a very deep bottom, about four miles
in circumference, whose surrounding hills
are covered with tall and shady trees.

<p>I never saw a place more formed for contemplation
and solemn ideas. In ancient
times there was a temple here sacred to
Diana. The lake itself was called Speculum
Dianæ, and Lacus Triviæ, and is
the place mentioned in the seventh Book
of the Æneid, where the Fury Alecto is
described blowing the trumpet of war, at
whose dreadful sound the woods and
mountains shook, and mothers, trembling
for their children, pressed them to their

<p>We returned by Gensano, Marino, La
Riccia, and Castel Gondolfo. All the villages
and villas I have named communicate
with each other by fine walks and
avenues of lofty trees, whose intermingling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
branches form a continued shade for
the traveller. Castel Gondolfo is a little
village near the lake Albano, on one extremity
of which is a castle, belonging
to his Holiness, from which the village
takes its name; there is nothing remarkably
fine in this villa, except its situation.
Near the village of Castel Gondolfo, is
the villa Barbarini, within the gardens of
which are the ruins of an immense palace,
built by the Emperor Domitian.
There is a charming walk, about a mile
in length, along the side of the lake from
Castel Gondolfo to the town of Albano.
The lake of Albano is an oval piece of
water of about seven or eight miles circumference,
whose margin is finely adorned
with groves and trees of various verdure,
beautifully reflected from the transparent
bosom of the lake; and which,
with the surrounding hills, and the Castel
Gondolfo which crowns one of them, has
a fine picturesque effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>The grand scale on which the beauties
of nature appear in Switzerland and the
Alps, has been considered by some, as too
vast for the pencil; but among the sweet hills
and vallies of Italy, her features are brought
nearer the eye, are fully seen and understood,
and appear in all the bloom of rural
loveliness. Tivoli, Albano, and Frescati,
therefore, are the favourite abodes of
the landscape-painters who travel to this
country for improvement; and in the opinion
of some, those delightful villages
furnish studies better suited to the powers
of their art, than even Switzerland itself.
Nothing can surpass the admirable assemblage
of hills, meadows, lakes, cascades,
gardens, ruins, groves, and terraces,
which charm the eye, as you wander
among the shades of Frescati and Albano,
which appear in new beauty as they are
viewed from different points, and captivate
the beholder with endless variety. One
reflection obtrudes itself on the mind, and
disturbs the satisfaction which such pleasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
scenes would otherwise produce;
it arises from beholding the poverty of
infinitely the greater part of the inhabitants
of those villages—Not that they seem
miserable or discontented—a few roasted
chesnuts, and some bunches of grapes,
which they may have for a penny, will
maintain them; but the easier they are
satisfied, and the less repining they are,
the more earnestly do we wish that they
were better provided for. Good heavens!
why should so much be heaped on a few,
whom profusion cannot satisfy; while a
bare competency is withheld from multitudes,
whom penury cannot render discontented?</p>

<p>The most commanding view is from
the garden of a convent of Capucins, at
no great distance from Albano. Directly
before you is the lake, with the mountains
and woods which surround it, and
the castle of Gondolfo; on one hand is
Frescati with all its villas; on the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
the towns of Albano, La Riccia, and Gensano;
beyond these you have an uninterrupted
view of the Campagna, with St.
Peter’s church and the city of Rome in
the middle; the whole prospect being
bounded by the hills of Tivoli, the
Apennines, and the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>While we contemplated all these objects
with pleasure and admiration, an
English gentleman of the party said to
Mr. B——, “There is not a prospect equal
to this in all France or Germany, and not
any superior even in England.” “That
I well believe,” replied the Caledonian;
“but if I had you in Scotland, I could
shew you several with which this is by
no means to be compared.” “Indeed!
Pray in what part of Scotland are they
to be seen?” “I presume you never
was at the castle of Edinburgh, Sir?”
“Never.” “Or at Stirling?” “Never.”
“Did you ever see Loch Lomond, Sir?”
“I never did.” “I suppose I need not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
ask, whether you have ever been in
Aberdeenshire, or the Highlands, or—”
“I must confess once for all,” interrupted the
Englishman, “that I have the misfortune
never to have seen any part of Scotland.”
“Then I am not surprised,”
said the Scot, taking a large pinch of
snuff, “that you think this the finest
view you ever saw.” “I presume you
think those in Scotland a great deal
finer?” “A very great deal indeed,
Sir; why that lake, for example, is a
pretty thing enough; I dare swear, many
an English nobleman would give a
good deal to have such another before
his house; but Loch Lomond is thirty
miles in length, Sir! there are above
twenty islands in it, Sir! that is a
lake for you. As for their desert of a
Campagna, as they call it, no man
who has eyes in his head, Sir, will
compare it to the fertile valley of Stirling,
with the Forth, the most beautiful
river in Europe, twining through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
it.” “Do you really in your conscience
imagine,” said the Englishman,
“that the Forth is a finer river than the
Thames?” “The Thames!” exclaimed
the North Briton, “Why, my dear Sir,
the Thames at London is a mere
gutter, in comparison of the Firth of
Forth at Edinburgh.” “I suppose
then,” said the Englishman, recovering
himself, “you do not approve of the
view from Windsor Castle?” “I ask
your pardon,” replied the other; “I
approve of it very much; it is an exceeding
pretty kind of a prospect; the
country appears from it as agreeable to
the sight as any plain flat country,
crowded with trees, and intersected by
enclosures, can well do; but I own I
am of opinion, that mere fertile fields,
woods, rivers, and meadows, can never,
of themselves, perfectly satisfy the
eye.” “You imagine, no doubt,” said
the Englishman, “that a few heath-covered
mountains and rocks embellish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
a country very much?” “I am
precisely of that opinion,” said the Scot;
“and you will as soon convince me that
a woman may be completely beautiful
with fine eyes, good teeth, and a fair
complexion, though she should not
have a <i>nose</i> on her face, as that a landscape,
or country, can be completely
beautiful without a mountain.” “Well,
but here are mountains enough,” resumed
the other; “look around you.”
“Mountains!” cried the Caledonian,
“very pretty mountains, truly! They
call that Castel Gondolfo of theirs a
castle too, and a palace, forsooth! but
does that make it a residence fit for a
Prince?” “Why, upon my word, I
do not think it much amiss,” said the
other; “it looks full as well as the palace
of St. James’s.” “The palace of St.
James’s,” exclaimed the Scot, “is a
scandal to the nation; it is both a
shame and a sin, that so great a monarch
as the King of Scotland, England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
and Ireland, with his Royal consort,
and their large family of small
children, should live in a shabby old cloister,
hardly good enough for monks.
The palace of Holyrood-house, indeed,
is a residence meet for a king.” “And
the gardens; pray what sort of gardens
have you belonging to that palace?” said
the Englishman; “I have been told you do
not excel in those.” “But we excel
in gardeners,” replied the other, “which
are as much preferable as the creator is
preferable to the created.” “I am surprised,
however,” rejoined the South Briton,
“that, in a country like yours, where
there are so many creators, so very few
fruit-gardens are created.” “Why, Sir, it
is not to be expected,” said Mr. B——,
“that anyone country will excel in every
thing. Some enjoy a climate more favourable
for peaches, and vines, and nectarines;
but, by G—, Sir, no country on earth produces
better men and women than Scotland.”
“I dare say none does,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
the other. “So as France excels in wines,
England in wool and oxen, Arabia in
horses, and other countries in other
animals, you imagine Scotland excels
all others in the human species.” “What
I said, Sir, was, that the human species
in no country excel those in Scotland;
and that I assert again, and will maintain,
Sir, to my last gasp.” “I do not intend
to deny it,” said the Englishman; “but
you will permit me to observe, that, men
being its staple commodity, it must be
owned that Scotland carries on a brisk
trade; for I know no country that has
a greater <i>exportation</i>; you will find
Scotchmen in all the countries of the
world.” “So much the better for all
the countries of the world,” said Mr.
B——; “for every body knows that the
Scotch cultivate and improve the arts
and sciences wherever they go.” “They
certainly improve their own fortunes
wherever they go,” rejoined the other;—“like
their gardeners, though they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
can create little or nothing at home,
they often create very good fortunes in
other countries; and this is one reason
of our having the pleasure of so much of
their company in London.” “Whether
it affords you pleasure or not,
Sir, nothing can be more certain,”
replied the Scot in the most serious tone,
“than that you may <i>improve</i> very much
by their company and example. But
there are various reasons,” continued he,
“for so many of my countrymen sojourning
in London. That city is now, in
some measure, the capital of Scotland as
well as of England. The seat of government
is there; the King of Scotland, as
well as of England, resides there; the
Scotch nobility and gentry have as good
a right to be near the person of their Sovereign
as the English; and you must
allow, that, if some Scotchmen make
fortunes in England, many of our
best estates are also spent there. But
you mean to say, that the Scotch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
in general, are poor in comparison of
the English. This we do not deny, and
cannot possibly forget, your countrymen
refresh our memories with it so often.
We allow, therefore, that you have this
advantage over us;—and the Persians
had the same over the Macedonians at
the battle of Arbela. But, whether
Scotland be poor or rich, those Scots
who settle in England must carry industry,
talents, or wealth with them,
otherwise they will starve there as well
as elsewhere; and when one country
draws citizens of this description from
another, I leave you to judge which has
the most reason to complain. And let
me tell you, Sir, upon the whole, the
advantages which England derives from
the Union, are manifest and manifold.”
“I cannot say,” replied the
Englishman, “that I have thought much
on this subject; but I shall be obliged to
you if you will enumerate a few of
them.” “In the first place,” resumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
the Scot, “Has she not greatly increased
in wealth since that time?” “She has
so,” replied the other, smiling, “and I
never knew the <i>real cause</i> before.” “In
the next place, Has she not acquired a
million and a half of subjects, who otherwise
would have been with her enemies?
For this, <i>and other reasons</i>, they are
equivalent to three millions. In the
third place, Has she not acquired security?
without which riches are of no value.
There is no door open <i>now</i>, Sir,
by which the French can enter into your
country. They dare as soon be d——
as attempt to invade Scotland; so if you
can defend your own coast, there is no
fear of you; but without a perfect union
with Scotland, England could not enjoy
the principal benefit she derives from her
insular situation.” “Not till Scotland
should be subdued,” said the Englishman.
“Subdued!” repeated the astonished
Scot; “let me tell you, Sir, <i>that</i>
is a very strange hypothesis; the fruitless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
attempts of many centuries might
have taught you that the thing is impossible;
and, if you are conversant in history,
you will find, that, after the decline
of the Roman Empire, the course
of conquest was from <i>the North to the
South</i>.” “You mean,” said the South
Briton, “that Scotland would have
conquered England.” “Sir,” replied
the other, “I think the English as brave
a nation as ever existed, and therefore I
will not say that the Scotch are braver;
far less shall I assert, that <i>they</i>, consisting
of only a fifth part of the numbers,
could subdue the English; but I am sure,
that rather than submit they would try;
and you will admit that the trial would
be no advantage to either country.”
“Although I am fully convinced,” said
the Englishman, “how the experiment
would end, I should be sorry to see it
made, particularly at this time.” “Yet,
Sir,” rejoined the Scot, “there are
people of your country, as I am told,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
who, even at <i>this time</i>, endeavour to exasperate
the minds of the inhabitants of
one part of Great Britain against the natives
of the other, and to create dissension
between two countries, whose mutual
safety depends on their good agreement;
two countries whom Nature herself, by
separating them from the rest of the
world, and encircling them with her
azure bond of union, seems to have intended
for one.” “I do assure you, my
good Sir,” said the English Gentleman,
“I am not of the number of those who
wish to raise such dissension. I love the
Scotch; I always thought them a sensible
and gallant people; and some of
the most valued friends I have on earth,
are of your country.” “You are a man
of honour and discernment,” said the
Caledonian, seizing him eagerly by the
hand; “and I protest, without prejudice
or partiality, that I never knew a man
of that character who was not of your
way of thinking.”</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXX">LETTER LXX.</h2>

<p class="right">Florence.</p>

<p>We arrived in this city the third day
after leaving Rome, though I have
delayed writing till now. I wished to know
something of the place, and to be a little
acquainted with the people. The last is not
difficult; because the Florentines are naturally
affable, and the hospitality and politeness
of the British Minister afford his
countrymen frequent opportunities of forming
an acquaintance with the best company
in Florence. This gentleman has been here
about thirty years, and is greatly esteemed
by the Florentines. It is probably owing
to this circumstance, and to the magnificent
stile in which some English Noblemen
live, who have long resided here, that the
English, in general, are favourites with the
inhabitants of this place. L——d C——r’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
conduct and disposition confirm them in
the opinion they long have had of the
good-nature and integrity of the nation to
which he belongs. His Lady is of an
amiable character, and affords them a very
favourable specimen of English beauty.</p>

<p>We have had no opportunity of seeing
the Grand Duchess. She is of a domestic
turn, and lives much in the country with
her children, of which she has a comfortable
number; but the Grand Duke having
come to town for two days, we had the
honour of being presented to him at the
Palazzo Pitti. There is a striking resemblance
of each other in all the branches of the
Austrian family. Wherever I had met
with the Grand Duke, I should immediately
have known that he belonged to it. He,
as well his brother who resides at Milan,
has, in a remarkable degree, the thick lip;
which has long been a distinguishing feature
in the Austrian family. He is a handsome
man, is rapid in his words and motions,
and has more vivacity in his manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
than either the Emperor or Archduke;
like them, he is good-humoured, condescending
and affable. After the extinction
of the Medici family, the Florentines
grumbled on account of the disadvantage
and inconveniency of having Sovereigns
who did not reside among them. They
exclaimed that their money was carried
away to a distant country, and the most
profitable offices at home filled by foreigners.
They have now got a Sovereign who
resides and spends his revenue among them,
and has provided the State most plentifully
in heirs; yet they still grumble. They
complain of the taxes—But in what country
of Europe is there not the same complaint?</p>

<p>Florence is, unquestionably, a very
beautiful city. Independent of the churches
and palaces, some of which are very magnificent,
the architecture of the houses in
general is in a good taste, the streets are
remarkably clean, and paved with large
broad stones, chiseled so as to prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
horses from sliding. This city is divided
into two unequal parts by the river Arno,
over which there are no less than four
bridges in sight of each other. That called
the Ponte della Trinità, is uncommonly
elegant. It is built entirely of white
marble, and ornamented with four beautiful
statues, representing the Four Seasons.
The quays, the buildings on each side, and
the bridges, render that part of Florence
through which the river runs, by far the
finest. The same is the case at Paris; and
it happens fortunately for those two cities,
that those parts are almost constantly before
the eye, on account of the necessity people
are continually under of passing and repassing
those bridges; whereas in London,
whose river and bridges are far superior to
any in France or Italy, people may live
whole seasons, attend all the public amusements,
and drive every day from one end
of the town to the other, without ever
seeing the Thames or the bridges, unless
they go on purpose. For this reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
when a foreigner is asked which he thinks
the finest city, Paris or London; the moment
Paris is mentioned, the Louvre, and
that striking part which is situated between
the Pont Royal and Pont Neuf, presents
itself to his imagination. He can recollect
no part of London equal in magnificence
to this; and ten to one, if he decides directly,
it will be in favour of Paris: but if
he takes a little more time, and compares
the two capitals, street by street, square by
square, and bridge with bridge, he will
probably be of a different opinion. The
number of inhabitants in Florence is calculated
by some at eighty thousand. The
streets, squares, and fronts of the palaces
are adorned with a great number of statues;
some of them by the best modern
masters, Michael Angelo, Bandinelli, Donatello,
Giovanni di Bologna, Benvenuto,
Cellini, and others. A taste for the arts
must be kept alive, independent almost of
any other encouragement, in a city where
so many specimens are continually before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
the eyes of the inhabitants. There are
towns in Europe, where statues, exposed
night and day within the reach of the
common people, would run a great risque
of being disfigured and mutilated; here
they are as safe as if they were shut up in
the Great Duke’s gallery.</p>

<p>Florence has been equally distinguished
by a spirit for commerce and for the fine
arts; two things which are not always
united. Some of the Florentine merchants
formerly were men of vast wealth, and
lived in a most magnificent manner. One
of them, about the middle of the fifteenth
century, built that noble fabric, which,
from the name of its founder, is still called
the Palazzo Pitti. The man was ruined
by the prodigious expence of this building,
which was immediately purchased by the
Medici family, and has continued, ever
since, to be the residence of the Sovereigns.
The gardens belonging to this palace are on
the declivity of an eminence. On the summit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
there is a kind of fort, called Belvedere.
From this, and from some of the higher
walks, you have a complete view of the
city of Florence, and the beauteous vale of
Arno, in the middle of which it stands.
The prospect is bounded on every side by
an amphitheatre of fertile hills, adorned
with country-houses and gardens. In no
part of Italy, that I have seen, are there so
many villas, belonging to private persons,
as in the neighbourhood of this city; the
habitations of the peasants, likewise, seem
much more neat and commodious. The
country all around is divided into small
farms, with a neat farm-house on each.
Tuscany produces a considerable quantity
of corn, as well as excellent wine, and great
quantities of silk. The peasants have a
look of health and contentment: the natural
beauty of the Italian countenance not
being disgraced by dirt, or deformed by
misery, the women in this country seem
handsomer, and are, in reality, more
blooming, than in other parts of Italy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
When at work, or when they bring their
goods to market, their hair is confined by
a silk net, which is also much worn at
Naples; but on holidays they dress in a
very picturesque manner. They do not
wear gowns, but a kind of jacket without
sleeves. They have no other covering for
the upper part of the arm but their shift
sleeves, which are tied with riband. Their
petticoats are generally of a scarlet colour.
They wear ear-rings and necklaces. Their
hair is adjusted in a becoming manner, and
adorned with flowers. Above one ear they
fix a little straw hat; and on the whole
have a more gay, smart, coquetish air, than
any country-girls I ever saw.</p>

<p>Churches, and palaces, and statues, are
no doubt ornamental to a city; and the
Princes are praise-worthy who have taken
pains to rear and collect them; but the
greatest of all ornaments are cheerful,
happy, living countenances. The taste is
not general; but, I thank God, I know some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
people who, to a perfect knowledge and
unaffected love of the fine arts, join a passion
for a collection of this kind, who cannot,
without uneasiness, see one face in a
different style, and whose lives and fortunes
are employed in smoothing the corrosions
of penury and misfortune, and <i>restoring</i> the
<i>original</i> air of satisfaction and cheerfulness
to the human countenance. Happy the

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXI">LETTER LXXI.</h2>

<p class="right">Florence.</p>

<p>I have generally, since our arrival at
Florence, passed two hours every forenoon
in the famous gallery. Connoisseurs,
and those who wish to be thought such, remain
much longer. But I plainly feel this
is enough for me; and I do not think it
worth while to prolong my visit after I begin
to be tired, merely to be thought what
I am not. Do not imagine, however, that
I am blind to the beauties of this celebrated
collection; by far the most valuable now
in the world.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting parts of it,
in the eyes of many, is the series of Roman
Emperors, from Julius Cæsar to Gallienus,
with a considerable number of their Empresses,
arranged opposite to them. This
series is almost complete; but wherever the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
bust of an Emperor is wanting, the place
is filled up by that of some other distinguished
Roman. Such an honour is bestowed
with great propriety on Seneca,
Cicero, or Agrippa, the son-in-law of Augustus.
But, on perceiving a head of Antinous,
the favourite of Adrian, among
them, a gentleman whispered me,—<i>that</i>
minion, pointing to the head, would not
have been admitted into such company
any where but in Florence. It ought,
however, to be remembered, that the Gallery
is not an Ægyptian court of judicature,
where Princes are tried, after death, for
crimes committed during their life. If the
vices of originals had excluded their portraits,
what would have become of the series
of Roman Emperors, and particularly
of the bust of the great Julius himself, who
was husband to all the wives and —— —— ——
The gallery is sacred to art, and every production
which she avows, has a right to a
place here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>Amidst those noble specimens of ancient
sculpture, some of the works of Michael
Angelo are not thought undeserving a place.
His Bacchus and Faunus, of which the
well-known story is told, have been by
some preferred to the two antique figures
representing the same.</p>

<p>The beautiful head of Alexander is universally
admired by all the virtuosi; though
they differ in opinion with regard to the
circumstance in which the sculptor has intended
to represent that hero. Some imagine
he is dying; Mr. Addison imagines
he sighs for new worlds to conquer; others
that he faints with pain and loss of blood
from the wounds he received at Oxydrace.
Others think the features express not bodily
pain or languor, but sorrow and remorse,
for having murdered his faithful friend
Clitus. You see how very uncertain a business
this of a virtuoso is. I can hardly
believe that the artist intended simply to
represent him dying; there was nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
very creditable in the manner he brought
on his death. Nor do I think he would
choose to represent him moaning, or languishing
with pain or sickness; there is
nothing heroic in that; nor do we sympathise
so readily with the pains of the body,
as with those of the mind. As for the
story of his weeping for new worlds, he
will excite still less sympathy, if that is
the cause of his affliction. The last conjecture,
therefore, that the artist intended to
represent him in a violent fit of remorse, is
the most probable. The unfinished bust of
Marcus Brutus, by Michael Angelo, admirably
expresses the determined firmness
of character which belonged to that virtuous
Roman. The artist, while he
wrought at this, seems to have had in his
mind Horace’s Ode</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">This would, in my opinion, be a more
suitable inscription for the bust, than the
concetto of Cardinal Bembo, which is at
present under it<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. Michael Angelo, in all
probability was pleased with the expression
he had already given the features, and
chose to leave it as an unfinished sketch,
rather than risk weakening it by an attempt
to improve it.</p>

<p>The virtuosi differ in opinion respecting
the Arrotino, or Whetter, as much as about
the head of Alexander. A young gentleman
said to an antiquarian, while he
contemplated the Arrotino, “I believe,
Sir, it is imagined that this statue was
intended for the slave, who, while he
was whetting his knife, overheard Catiline’s
conspiracy.”—“That is the vulgar
opinion,” said the other; “but the
statue was, in reality, done for a peasant,
who discovered the plot into which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
the two sons of Junius Brutus entered
for the restoration of Tarquin.” “I
ask pardon, Sir,” said the young man;
“but although one may easily see that
the figure listens with the most exquisite
expression of attention, yet I should
think it very difficult to delineate in the
features, whether the listener heard a
conspiracy, or any thing else which
greatly interested him, and absolutely
impossible to mark, by any expression
of countenance, what particular conspiracy
he is hearing.” “Your observation
is just, young man,” said the
antiquarian, “when applied to modern
artists, but entirely the reverse when
applied to the ancient. Now, for my
own part, I plainly perceive in that
man’s countenance, and after you have
studied those matters as profoundly as
I have done you will see the same, that
it is the conspiracy for the restoration
of Tarquin, and no other plot whatever,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
which he listens to; as for Catiline’s
conspiracy, it is not possible he
could know any thing about it; for,
good God! people ought to reflect,
that the man must have been dead four
hundred years before Catiline was born.”</p>

<p>As we are now in the famous octogonal
room, called Tribuna, I ought, if I had
any thing new to say, to descant a little on
the distinguishing excellencies of the Dancing
Faun, the Wrestlers, the Venus Urania, the
Venus Victrix; and I would most willingly
pay the poor tribute of my praise to that
charming figure known by the name of
Venus de Medicis. Yet, in the midst of
all my admiration, I confess I do not
think her equal to her brother Apollo in
the Vatican. In that sublime figure, to the
most perfect features and proportions, is
joined an air which seems more than human.
The Medicean Venus is unquestionably
a perfect model of female beauty;
but while Apollo appears more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
man, the Venus seems precisely a beautiful
woman.</p>

<p>In the same room are many valuable
curiosities, besides a collection of admirable
pictures by the best masters. I do
not know whether any are more excellent
of their kind, but I am convinced none
are more attentively considered than the
two Venuses of Titian; one is said to be
a portrait of his wife, the other of his
mistress. The first is the fined portrait I
ever saw, except the second; of this you
have seen many copies: though none of
them equals the beauty of the original,
yet they will give a juster idea of it than
any description of mine could. On the
back ground, two women seem searching
for something in a trunk. This episode
is found much fault with; for my part, I
see no great harm the two poor women
do: none but those critics who search
more eagerly after <i>deformity</i> than <i>beauty</i>,
will take any notice of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides the Gallery and Tribuna, the
hundredth part of whose treasures I have
not particularised, there are other rooms,
whose contents are indicated by the names
they bear; as, the Cabinet of Arts, of Astronomy,
of Natural History, of Medals,
of Porcelain, of Antiquities, and the Saloon
of the Hermaphrodite, so called
from a statue which divides the admiration
of the Amateurs with that in the
Borghese village at Rome. The excellence
of the execution is disgraced by the
vileness of the subject. We are surprised
how the Greeks and Romans could take
pleasure in such unnatural figures; in this
particular their taste seems to have been
as depraved, as in general it was elegant
and refined. In this room there is a
collection of drawings by some of the
greatest masters, Michael Angelo, Raphael,
Andrea del Sarto, and others. There is, in
particular, a sketch of the Last Judgment
by the first-named of these painters, different,
and, in the opinion of some, designed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
with more judgment, than his famous
picture on the same subject in Sixtus
the Fourth’s chapel in the Vatican.</p>

<p>The large room, called the Gallery of
Portraits, is not the least curious in this
vast Musæum. It contains the portraits,
all executed by themselves, of the most
eminent painters who have flourished in
Europe during the three last centuries.
They amount to above two hundred; those
of Rubens, Vandyke, Rembrandt, and
Guido, were formerly the most esteemed;
two have been added lately, which vie
with the finest in this collection—those of
Meng’s and Sir Joshua Reynolds. The
portrait of Raphael seems to have been
done when he was young; it is not equal
to any of the above. The Electress
Dowager of Saxony has made a valuable
addition to this collection, by sending
her own portrait painted by herself; she
is at full length, with the palette and
pencils in her hands. Coreggio, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
hearing the picture of St. Cecilia at Bologna
cried up as a prodigy, and the <i>ne
plus ultra</i> of art, went to see it; and conscious
that there was nothing in it that required
the exertion of greater powers than
he felt within himself, he was overheard to
say, “Anch’ io sono pittore.” This illustrious
princess was also conscious of her
powers when she painted this portrait,
which seems to pronounce to the spectators,
<i>Anch’ io sono pittrice</i>.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXII">LETTER LXXII.</h2>

<p class="right">Florence.</p>

<p>Having now crossed from the Adriatic
to the Mediterranean, and travelled
through a considerable part of Italy,
I acknowledge I have been agreeably disappointed
in finding the state of the
poorer part of the inhabitants less wretched
than, from the accounts of some travellers,
I imagined it was; and I may
with equal truth add, that although I
have not seen so much poverty as I was
taught to expect, yet I have seen far more
poverty than misery. Even the extremity
of indigence is accompanied with
less wretchedness here than in many other
countries. This is partly owing to the
mildness of the climate and fertility of
the soil, and partly to the peaceable, religious,
and contented disposition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
people. The miseries which the poorer
part of mankind suffer from cold, are,
perhaps, greater than those derived from
any other source whatever. But in Italy,
the gentleness of the climate protects
them from this calamity nine months
of the year. If they can gather as much
wood as to keep a moderate fire during
the remaining three, and procure a coarse
cloke, they have little to fear from that
quarter. Those who cannot get employment,
which is often the case in this
country, and even those who do not
choose to work, which is the case with
numbers all the world over, receive a
regular maintenance from some convent:
with this, and what little they can pick
up otherwise, in a country where provisions
are plentiful and cheap, they pass
through life, in their own opinion, with
more satisfaction than if they had a greater
number of conveniencies procured by
much bodily labour. Whereas in Great
Britain, Germany, and other northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
countries, the poor have no choice but to
work; for if they remain idle, they are
exposed to miseries more intolerable than
the hardest labour can occasion to the
laziest of mankind; they are invaded at
once by the accumulated agonies of
hunger and cold; and if they have ever
had sufficient credit to contract a little
debt, they are continually in danger of
being thrown into a jail among pickpockets
and felons. With respect to the
lowest of the tradespeople and the day-labourers
in this country, their wages are
certainly not high; nor are they willing,
by great efforts of industry, to gain all
they might; but what they do gain is
never wasted in intemperance, but fairly
spent in their families on the real necessaries
and comforts of life.</p>

<p>The Italians are the greatest loungers
in the world, and while walking in the
fields, or stretched in the shade, seem to
enjoy the serenity and genial warmth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
their climate with a degree of luxurious
indulgence peculiar to themselves. Without
ever running into the daring excesses
of the English, or displaying the frisky
vivacity of the French, or the invincible
phlegm of the Germans, the Italian
populace discover a species of sedate sensibility
to every source of enjoyment, from
which, perhaps, they derive a greater degree
of happiness than any of the other.
The frequent processions and religious
ceremonies, besides amusing and comforting
them, serve to fill up their time, and
prevent that ennui and those immoral
practices which are apt to accompany poverty
and idleness. It is necessary, for
the quiet and happiness of every community,
that the populace be employed.
Some politicians imagine, that their whole
time should be spent in gainful industry.
Others think, that though the riches of
the state will not be augmented, yet the
general happiness, which is a more important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
object, will be promoted by blending
the occupations of industry with a
considerable proportion of such superstitious
ceremonies as awaken the future
hopes, without lulling the present benevolence,
of the multitude; but nobody
can doubt, that in countries where, from
whatever cause, industry does not prevail,
processions and other rites of the same
nature will tend to restrain the populace
from the vices, and of consequence prevent
some of the miseries of idleness.</p>

<p>The peasantry of this country are unquestionably
in a more comfortless state
than a benevolent mind could wish them.
But, England and Switzerland excepted,
is not this the case all over Europe? In
all the countries I have seen, or had an
account of, the husbandmen, probably
the most virtuous, but certainly the most
useful part of the community, whose
labour and industry maintain all the rest,
and in whom the real strength of the state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
resides, are, by a most unjust dispensation,
generally the poorest and most oppressed.
But although the Italian peasantry are by
no means in the affluent, independent situation
of the peasantry of Switzerland, and
the tenantry of England, yet they are
not subjected to the same oppressions with
those of Germany, nor are they so poor
as those of France.</p>

<p>Great part of the lands in Italy belong
to convents; and I have observed, and
have been assured by those who have the
best opportunities of knowing, that the
tenants of these communities are happier,
and live more at their ease, than those of
a great part of the nobility. The revenues
of convents are usually well managed,
and never allowed to be squandered
away by the folly or extravagance of any
of its members; consequently the community
is not driven, by craving and
threatening creditors, as individuals frequently
are, to squeeze out of their vassals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
the means of supplying the waste occasioned
by their own vanity and expence.
A convent can have no incitement to severe
and oppressive exactions from the peasants,
except sheer avarice; a passion which never
rises to such a height in a society where the
revenue is in common, as in the breast of
an individual, who is solely to reap the
fruits of his own oppression.</p>

<p>The stories which circulate in Protestant
countries, concerning the scandalous debauchery
of monks, and the luxurious
manner in which they live in their convents,
whatever truth there may have been
in them formerly, are certainly now in a
great measure without foundation. I remember
when I was at the Grande Chartreuse,
near Grenoble, which has a considerable
district of land belonging to it, I
was informed, and this information was
confirmed by what I saw, that those monks
were gentle and generous masters, and that
their tenants were envied by all the peasantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
around, on account of the treatment
they received, and the comparatively easy
terms on which they held their farms.
From the enquiries I have made in France,
Germany, and Italy, I am convinced that
this is usually the case with those peasants
who belong to convent lands; and very
often, I have been informed, besides having
easy rents, they also find affectionate
friends and protectors in their masters,
who visit them in sickness, comfort them in
all distresses, and are of service to their families
in various shapes.</p>

<p>I have been speaking hitherto of the peasantry
belonging to convents; but I believe
I might extend the remark to the tenants
of ecclesiastics in general, though they are
often represented as more proud and oppressive
masters than any class of men
whatever; an aspersion which may have
gained credit the more easily on this account,
that instances of cruelty and oppression in
ecclesiastics strike more, and raise a greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
indignation, than the same degree of wickedness
in other men; they raise a greater
indignation, because they are more unbecoming
of clergymen, and they strike
more when they do happen, because they
happen seldomer. The ambition of Popes
some centuries ago, when the Court of
Rome was in its zenith, the unlimited influence
and power which particular Churchmen
acquired in England and France, had
those effects upon their actions and characters,
which ambition and power usually
have on the characters of men; it rendered
them insolent, unfeeling, and persecuting.
Yet, for every cruel and tyrannical Pope
that history has recorded, it will be easy to
name two or three Roman Emperors who
have surpassed them in every species of
wickedness; and England and France have
had Prime Ministers with all the vices,
without the abilities, of Wolsey and Richelieu.</p>

<p>Those who declaim against the wickedness
of the clergy, seem to take it for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
granted that this body of men were the authors
of the most horrid instances of persecution,
massacre, and tyranny, over men’s
consciences, that are recorded in the annals
of mankind; yet Philip II., Charles IX.
and Henry VIII. were not Churchmen;
and the capricious tyranny of Henry, the
frantic fury of Charles, and the persevering
cruelty of Philip, seem to have proceeded
from the personal characters of these Monarchs,
or to have been excited by what
they considered as their political interest,
rather than by the suggestions of their
Clergy.</p>

<p>As the subjects of the Ecclesiastical State
are perhaps the poorest in Italy, this has
been imputed to the rapacious disposition
which some assert is natural to Churchmen.
This poverty, however, may be otherwise
accounted for. Bishop Burnet very judiciously
observes, that the subjects of a government,
which is at once despotic and
elective, labour under peculiar disadvantages;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
for an hereditary Prince will naturally
have considerations for his people
which an elective one will not, “unless he
has a degree of generosity not common
among men, and least of all among
Italians, who have a passion for their
families which is not known in other
places<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.” An elective Prince, knowing
that it is only during his reign that his
family can receive any benefit from it,
makes all the haste he can to enrich them.
To this it may be added, that as Popes generally
arrive at Sovereignty at an age
when avarice predominates in the human
breast, they may be supposed to have a
stronger bias than other Princes to that
sordid passion; and even when this does
not take place, their needy relations are
continually prompting them to acts of oppression,
and suggesting ways and means
of squeezing the people. Other causes
might be assigned; but, that it does not
originate from the imputation above mentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
seems evident from this, that the
peasants of particular ecclesiastics, and of
the convents in the Pope’s dominions, as
well as in other countries, are generally
less oppressed than those of the lay lords
and princes.</p>

<p>From what has been thrown out by
some celebrated wits, and the common-place
invective of those who affect that character,
one would be led to imagine that
there is something in the nature of the clerical
profession which has a tendency to
render men proud and oppressive. Such
indiscriminating censure carries no conviction
to my mind, because it is contradicted
by the experience I have had in life, and
by the observations, such as they are,
which I have been able to make on human
nature. I do not mean, in imitation of the
satirists above mentioned, to put the
Clergy of all religions on the same footing.
My opportunities of knowledge are too
slender to justify <i>that</i>; my acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
with this order of men having been in a
great measure confined to those of the Protestant
Church, men of learning and ingenuity,
of quiet, speculative, and benevolent
dispositions; it is usually, indeed, this
turn of mind which has inclined them to
the ecclesiastical profession. But though my
acquaintance with the Roman Catholic
Clergy is very limited, yet the few I do
know could not be mentioned as exceptions to
what I have just said of the Protestant; and,
exclusive of all personal knowledge of the
men, it is natural to think that the habitual
performance of the ceremonies of the Christian
religion, though intermingled with
some superstitious rites, and the preaching
the doctrines of benevolence and good-will
towards men, must have some influence on
the lives and characters of those who are
thus employed. It is a common error,
prevailing in Protestant countries, to imagine
that the Roman Catholic Clergy laugh
at the religion they inculcate, and regard
their flocks as the dupes of an artful plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
of imposition. By far the greater part of
Roman Catholic priests and monks are
themselves most sincere believers, and teach
the doctrines of Christianity, and all the
miracles of the legend, with a perfect conviction
of their divinity and truth. The
few who were behind the curtain when
falsehood was first embroidered upon truth,
and those who have at different periods been
the authors of all the masks and interludes
which have enriched the grand drama of
superstition, have always chosen to employ
such men, being sensible that the inferior
actors would perform their parts more perfectly,
by acting from nature and real conviction.
“Paulum interesse censes,” says
Davus to Mysis, “ex animo omnia ut
fert natura, facias an de industria<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.”</p>

<p>The accounts we receive of their gluttony,
are often as ill-founded as those of
their infidelity. The real character of the
majority of monks and inferior ecclesiastics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
both in France and Italy, is that of a simple,
superstitious, well-meaning race of men,
who for the most part live in a very abstemious
and mortified manner, notwithstanding
what we have heard of their gluttony,
their luxury, and voluptuousness. Such accusations
are frequently thrown out by those
who are ill entitled to make them. I remember
being in company with an acquaintance
of yours, who is distinguished
for the delicacy of his table and the length
of his repasts, from which he seldom retires
without a bottle of Burgundy for his own
share, not to mention two or three glasses
of Champaign between the courses. We
had dined a few miles from the town in
which we then lived, and were returning
in his chariot; it was winter, and he was
wrapped in fur to the nose. As we drove
along, we met two friars walking through
the snow; little threads of icicles hung
from their beards; their legs and the upper
part of their feet were bare, but their soles
were defended from the snow by wooden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
sandals. “There goes a couple of dainty
rogues,” cried your friend as we drew
near them; “only think of the folly of
permitting such lazy, luxurious rascals to
live in a State, and eat up the portion of
the poor. I will engage that those two
scoundrels, as lean and mortified as
they look, will devour more victuals in
a day, than would maintain two industrious
families.” He continued railing
against the luxury of those two friars, and
afterwards expatiated upon the epicurism of
the clergy in general; who, he said, were
all alike in every country, and of every religion.
When we arrived in town, he told
me he had ordered a little nice supper to be
got ready at his house by the time of our
return, and had lately got some excellent
wine, inviting me at the same time to go
home with him; for, continued he, as <i>we
have driven</i> three miles in such weather,
<i>we stand in great need</i> of some refreshment.</p>

<p>That in all Roman Catholic countries,
and particularly in Italy, the clergy are too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
numerous, have too much power, too great
a proportion of the lands, and that some
of them live in great pomp and luxury, is
undeniable. That the common people
would be in a better situation, if manufactures
and the spirit of industry could be introduced
among them, is equally true; but,
even as things are, I cannot help thinking
that the state of the Italian peasantry is preferable,
in many respects, to that of the
peasants of many other countries in Europe.
They are not beaten by their ecclesiastical
lords, as those of Germany are by their
masters, on every real or imaginary offence.
They have not their children torn from
them, to be sacrificed to the pomp, avarice,
or ambition of some military despot; nor
are they themselves pressed into the service
as soldiers for life.</p>

<p>In England and in France the people
take an interest in all national disputes, and
consider the cause of their country or their
Prince as their own; they enter into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
service voluntarily, and fight with ardour
for the glory of the country or King they
love. Those ideas enable them to submit
to a thousand hardships without repining,
and they feel the sensations of happiness in
the midst of toil, want, and danger. But
in Germany, where the passions are annihilated,
and a man is modelled into a machine
before he is thought a good soldier,
where his blood is sold by the Prince to the
highest bidder, where he has no quarrel
with the enemy he murders, and no allegiance
to the Monarch for whom he fights,
the being liable to be forced into such a service,
is one of the most dreadful of all calamities.
Yet a regiment of such compelled
soldiers, dressed in gaudy uniform, and
powdered for a review, with music sounding
and colours flying, makes a far more
brilliant appearance than a cluster of peasants
with their wives and children upon a
holiday. But if we could examine the
breasts of the individuals, we should find in
those of the former nothing but the terror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
of punishment, hatred of their officers,
distrust of each other, and life itself supported
only by the hope of desertion; while
the bosoms of the latter are filled with all
the affections of humanity, undisturbed by
fear or remorse.</p>

<p class="right">Florence.</p>

<p>Society seems to be on an easy and
agreeable footing in this city. Besides
the conversazionis which they have here,
as in other towns of Italy, a number of the
nobility meet every day at a house called
the Casino. This society is pretty much
on the same footing with the clubs in London.
The members are elected by ballot.
They meet at no particular hour, but go at
any time that is convenient. They play
at billiards, cards, and other games, or
continue conversing the whole evening, as
they think proper. They are served with
tea, coffee, lemonade, ices, or what other
refreshments they choose; and each person
pays for what he calls for. There is one
material difference between this and the
English clubs, that women as well as men
are members.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>The company of both sexes behave with
more frankness and familiarity to strangers,
as well as to each other, than is customary
in public assemblies in other parts of Italy.</p>

<p>The Opera at Florence is a place where
the people of quality pay and receive visits,
and converse as freely as at the Casino
above mentioned. This occasions a continual
passing and repassing to and from the
boxes, except in those where there is a
party of cards formed; it is then looked on
as a piece of ill manners to disturb the
players. I never was more surprised, than
when it was proposed to me to make one of
a whist party, in a box which seemed to
have been made for the purpose, with a
little table in the middle. I hinted that it
would be full as convenient to have the
party somewhere else; but I was told, good
music added greatly to the pleasure of a
whist party; that it increased the joy of
good fortune, and soothed the affliction of
bad. As I thought the people of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
country better acquainted than myself with
the power of music, I contested the point no
longer; but have generally played two or
three rubbers at whist in the stage-box every
opera night.</p>

<p>From this you may guess, that, in this
city, as in some other towns in Italy, little
attention is paid to the music by the company
in the boxes, except at a new opera,
or during some favourite air. But the
dancers command a general attention: as
soon as they begin, conversation ceases;
even the card-players lay down their cards,
and fix their eyes on the Ballette. Yet the
excellence of Italian dancing seems to consist
in feats of strength, and a kind of jerking
agility, more than in graceful movement.
There is a continual contest among
the performers, who shall spring highest.
You see here none of the sprightly, alluring
gaiety of the French comic dancers, nor of
the graceful attitudes, and smooth flowing
motions of the performers in the serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
opera at Paris. It is surprising, that a
people of such taste and sensibility as the
Italians, should prefer a parcel of athletic
jumpers to elegant dancers.</p>

<p>On the evenings on which there is no
opera, it is usual for the genteel company
to drive to a public walk immediately
without the city, where they remain till it
begins to grow duskish. Soon after our
arrival at Florence, in one of the avenues
of this walk we observed two men and two
ladies, followed by four servants in livery.
One of the men wore the insignia of the
garter. We were told this was the Count
Albany, and that the Lady next to him was
the Countess. We yielded the walk, and
pulled off our hats. The gentleman along
with them was the Envoy from the King of
Prussia to the Court of Turin. He whispered
the Count, who, returning the salutation,
looked very earnestly at the D—— of
H——. We have seen them almost every
evening since, either at the opera or on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
public walk. His G—does not affect to
shun the avenue in which they happen to
be; and as often as we pass near them, the
Count fixes his eyes in a most expressive
manner upon the D——, as if he meant to
say—our ancestors were better acquainted.</p>

<p>You know, I suppose, that the Count
Albany is the unfortunate Charles Stuart,
who left Rome some time since on the death
of his father, because the Pope did not
think proper to acknowledge him by the
title which he claimed on that event. He
now lives at Florence, on a small revenue
allowed him by his brother. The Countess
is a beautiful woman, much beloved by
those who know her, who universally describe
her as lively, intelligent, and agreeable.
Educated as I was in Revolution
principles, and in a part of Scotland where
the religion of the Stuart family, and the
maxims by which they governed, are more
reprobated than perhaps in any part of
Great Britain, I could not behold this unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
person without the warmest emotion
and sympathy. What must a man’s
feelings be, who finds himself excluded
from the most brilliant situation, and noblest
inheritance that this world affords, and reduced
to an humiliating dependance on
those, who, in the natural course of events,
should have looked up to him for protection
and support? What must his feelings
be, when on a retrospective view he beholds
a series of calamities attending his family,
that is without example in the annals
of the unfortunate; calamities, of
which those they experienced after their
accession to the throne of England, were
only a continuation? Their misfortunes
began with their royalty, adhered to them
through ages, increased with the increase
of their dominions, did not forsake them
when dominion was no more; and, as he
has reason to dread, from his own experience,
are not yet terminated. It will afford
no alleviation or comfort, to recollect that
part of this black list of calamities arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
from the imprudence of his ancestors; and
that many gallant men, in England, Scotland,
and Ireland, have at different periods
been involved in their ruin.</p>

<p>Our sympathy for this unfortunate person
is not checked by any blame which
can be thrown on himself. He surely had
no share in the errors of the first Charles,
the profligacy of the second, or the impolitic
and bigotted attempts of James against
the laws and established religion of Great
Britain and Ireland; therefore, whilst I contemplate
with approbation and gratitude
the conduct of those patriots who resisted
and expelled that infatuated monarch, ascertained
the rights of the subject, and settled
the constitution of Great Britain on the
firm basis of freedom on which it has stood
ever since the Revolution, and on which I
hope it will ever stand, yet I freely acknowledge,
that I never could see the unfortunate
Count Albany without sentiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
of compassion, and the most lively sympathy.</p>

<p>I write with the more warmth, as I have
heard of some of our countrymen, who,
during their tours through Italy, made the
humble state to which he is reduced a frequent
theme of ridicule, and who, as often
as they met him in public, affected to pass
by with an air of sneering insult. The
motive to this is as base and abject as the
behaviour is unmanly; those who endeavour
to make misfortune an object of ridicule,
are themselves the objects of detestation.
A British nobleman or gentleman
has certainly no occasion to form an
intimacy with the Count Albany; but
while he appears under that name, and
claims no other title, it is ungenerous, on
every accidental meeting, not to behave to
him with the respect due to a man of high
rank, and the delicacy due to a man highly
unfortunate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>One thing is certain; that the same disposition
which makes men insolent to the
weak, renders them slaves to the powerful;
and those who are most apt to treat
this unfortunate person with an ostentatious
contempt at Florence, would have
been his most abject flatterers at St.
James’s.</p>

<p class="right">Florence.</p>

<p>In a country where men are permitted
to speak and write without restraint on
the measures of government; where almost
every citizen may flatter himself
with the hopes of becoming a part of the
legislature; where eloquence, popular talents,
and political intrigues, lead to honours,
and open a broad road to wealth
and power; men, after the first glow of
youth is past, are more obedient to the
loud voice of ambition than to the whispers
of love. But in despotic states, and
in monarchies which verge towards despotism,
where the will of the prince is
law; or, which amounts nearly to the
same thing, where the law yields to the
will of the prince; where it is dangerous
to speak or write on general politics, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
death or imprisonment to censure the particular
measures of government; love becomes
a first, instead of being a secondary
object; for ambition is, generally speaking,
a more powerful passion than love;
and on this account women are the objects
of greater attention and respect in
despotic than in free countries. That
species of address to women which is now
called gallantry, was, if I am not mistaken,
unknown to the ancient Greeks
and Romans; nothing like it appears in
any of Terence’s comedies, where one
would naturally expert to find it, if any
such thing had existed when they were
written. It now prevails, in some degree,
in every country of Europe, but appears
in different forms according to the different
characters, customs, and manners,
of the various countries.</p>

<p>In the courts of Germany it is a formal
piece of business; etiquette governs the
arrows of Cupid, as well as the torch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
Hymen. Mistresses are chosen from the
number of quarters on their family coats
of arms, as well as from the number of
their personal charms; and those ladies
who are well provided in the first, seldom
are without lovers, however deficient they
may be in the second. But though many
avenues, which in England lead to power
and distinction, are shut up in Germany,
and the whole power of government is
vested in the sovereign, yet the young
nobility cannot bestow a great deal of
their time in gallantry. The military
profession, which in the time of peace is
perfect idleness in France and England, is
a very serious, unremitting employment in
Germany. Men who are continually
drilling soldiers, and whose fortunes and
reputations depend on the expertness of
the troops under their command, cannot
pay a great deal of attention to the ladies.</p>

<p>Every French gentleman must be a soldier;
but fighting is the only part of the business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
they go through with spirit; they
cannot submit to the German precision in
discipline, their souls sink under the tediousness
of a campaign, and they languish
for a battle from the impetuosity of their
disposition, and impatience to have the
matter decided one way or the other.
This, with many particular exceptions, is
the general style of the French noblesse;
they all serve an apprenticeship to war,
but gallantry is the profession they follow
for life. In England, the spirit of play
and of party draws the minds of the
young men of fortune from love or gallantry;
those who spend their evenings at
a gaming house, or in parliament, seldom
think of any kind of women but such as
may be had without trouble; and, of
course, women of character are less attended
to than in some other countries.
When I was last at Paris, the Marquis de
F—— found an English newspaper on
my table; it contained a long and particular
account of a debate which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
happened in both houses of parliament; he
read it with great attention while I finished
a letter, and then throwing down the
paper, he said to me, “Mais, mon ami,
pendant que vos messieurs s’amusent a
jaser comme cela dans votre chambre
des pairs et votre parlement<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, parbleu
un etranger auroit beau jeu avec leurs
femmes.”</p>

<p>Intrigues of gallantry, comparatively
speaking, occur seldom in England; and
when they do, they generally proceed from
a violent passion, to which every consideration
of fortune and reputation is sacrificed,
and the business concludes in a
flight to the continent, or a divorce.</p>

<p>They manage matters otherwise in
France; you hardly ever hear of flights
or divorces in that country; a hundred
new arrangements are made, and as
many old ones broken, in a week at Paris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
without noise or scandal; all is conducted
quietly et felon les régles; the fair sex
are the universal objects of respect and
adoration, and yet there is no such thing
as constancy in the nation. Wit, beauty,
and every accomplishment united in one
woman, could not fix the volatility of a
Frenchman; the love of variety, and the
vanity of new conquests, would make him
abandon this phœnix for birds far less
rare and estimable. The women in France,
who are full of spirit and sensibility, could
never endure such usage, if they were
not as fickle and as fond of new conquests
as their lovers.</p>

<p>In Italy, such levity is viewed with contempt,
and constancy is, by both sexes,
still classed among the virtues.</p>

<p>That high veneration for the fair sex
which prevailed in the ages of chivalry, continued
long after in the form of a sentimental
platonic kind of gallantry. Every man
of ingenuity chose unto himself a mistress,
and directly proclaimed her beauty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
her cruelty in love ditties, madrigals, and
elegies, without expecting any other recompence
than the reputation of a constant
lover and a good poet. By the mere
force of imagination, and the eloquence
of their own metaphysical sonnets, they
became persuaded that their mistresses
were possessed of every accomplishment
of face and mind, and that themselves
were dying for love.</p>

<p>As in those days women were constantly
guarded by their fathers and brothers before
marriage, and watched and confined
by their husbands for the rest of their
lives; the refined passions above described
were not exposed to the same accidents which
so frequently befal those of modern lovers;
they could neither fall into a decay from a
more perfect knowledge of the ladies character,
nor were they liable to sudden death
from enjoyment. But whilst the women
were adored in song, they were miserable in
reality; confinement and distrust made
them detest their husbands, and they endeavoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
to form connections with men
more to their taste than either jealous husbands
or metaphysical lovers. To treat
a woman of character as if she were an
unprincipled wanton, is the most likely
way to make her one. In those days of
jealousy, a continual trial of skill seems to
have subsisted between husband and wife,
as if every lord, soon after marriage, had
told his lady, “Now, Madam, I know
perfectly well what you would be at;
but it is my business to prevent you:
I’ll guard you so well, and watch you
so closely, that it shall never be in your
power to gratify your inclinations.”
“You are perfectly in the right, my
lord,” replied the lady, with all meekness,
“pray guard and watch as your
wisdom shall direct; I, also, shall be vigilant
on my part, and we shall see how
the business will end.” The business
generally did end as might have been expected;
and the only consolation left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
husband was, to endeavour to assassinate
the happy lover.</p>

<p>But when French manners began to
spread over Europe, and to insinuate
themselves among nations the most opposite
in character to the French, jealousy
was first held up as the most detestable of
all the passions. The law had long declared
against its dismal effects, and awful
denunciations had been pronounced
from the pulpit against those who were
inflamed by its bloody spirit; but without
effect, till ridicule joined in the argument,
and exposed those husbands to the contempt
and derision of every fashionable
society, who harboured the gloomy dæmon
in their bosoms.</p>

<p>As in England, after the Restoration,
people, to shew their aversion to the Puritans,
turned every appearance of religion
into ridicule, and from the extreme
of hypocrisy flew at once to that of profligacy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
so in Italy, from the custom
of secluding the wife from all mankind
but her husband, it became the fashion
that she should never be seen with her
husband, and yet always have a man at her
elbow.</p>

<p>I shall conclude what I have to say on
this subject in my next.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The French in general are apt to make the same

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXV">LETTER LXXV.</h2>

<p class="right">Florence.</p>

<p>Before the Italian husbands could
adopt or reconcile their minds to a
custom so opposite to their former practice,
they took some measures to secure a
point which they had always thought of
the highest importance. Finding that confinement
was a plan generally reprobated,
and that any appearance of jealousy subjected
the husband to ridicule, they agreed
that their wives should go into company
and attend public places, but always attended
by a friend whom they could trust, and who,
at the same time, should not be disagreeable
to the wife. This compromise could not fail
of being acceptable to the women, who
plainly perceived that they must be gainers
by any alteration of the former system;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
and it soon became universal all over Italy,
for the women to appear at public places
leaning upon the arm of a man; who,
from their frequently whispering together,
was called her Cicisbeo. It was stipulated,
at the same time, that the lady,
while abroad under his care, should converse
with no other man but in his presence,
and with his approbation; he was
to be her guardian, her friend, and gentleman-usher.</p>

<p>The custom at present is, that this obsequious
gentleman visits the lady every
forenoon at the toilet, where the plan
for passing the evening is agreed upon;
he disappears before dinner, for it is
usual all over Italy for the husband and
wife to dine together tête-à-tête, except
on great occasions, as when there is a
public feast. After dinner the husband
retires, and the Cicisbeo returns and conducts
the lady to the public walk, the conversazioné,
or the opera; he hands her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
about wherever she goes, presents her
coffee, sorts her cards, and attends with
the most pointed assiduity till the amusements
of the evening are over; he accompanies
her home, and delivers up his
charge to the husband, who is then supposed
to resume his functions.</p>

<p>From the nature of this connection, it
could not be an easy matter to find a Cicisbeo
who would be equally agreeable to
the husband and wife. At the beginning
of the institution, the husbands, as I have
been informed, preferred the platonic
swains, who professed only the metaphysicks
of love, and whose lectures, they
imagined, might refine their wives ideas,
and bring them to the same way of thinking;
in many instances, no doubt, it
would happen, that the platonic admirer
asked with <i>less seraphic ends</i>; but these
instances serve only as proofs that the husbands
were mistaken in their men; for
however absurd it may appear in the eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
of some people, to imagine that the husbands
believe it is only a platonic connection
which subsists between their wives
and the Cicisbeos; it is still more absurd
to believe, as some strangers who have
passed through this country seem to have
done, that this whole system of Cicisbeism
was from the beginning, and is now, an
universal system of adultery connived at
by every Italian husband. To get clear
of one difficulty, those gentlemen fall into
another much more inexplicable; by supposing
that the men, who of all the inhabitants
of Europe were the most scrupulous
with regard to their wives chastity, should
acquiesce in, and in a manner become subservient
to, their prostitution. In support of
this strange doctrine, they assert, that the
husbands being the Cicisbeos of other women,
cannot enjoy this privilege on any
other terms; and are therefore contented to
sacrifice their wives for the sake of their
mistresses. That some individuals may
be profligate enough to act in this manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
I make no doubt. Similar arrangements
we hear instances of in every country;
but that such a system is general, or
any thing near it, in Italy, seems to me perfectly
incredible, and is contrary to the best
information I have received since I have been
here. It is also urged, that most of the married
men of quality in Italy act in the character
of Cicisbeo to some woman or other; and
those who are not Platonic lovers, ought to
suspect that the same liberties are taken
with their wives which they take with the
spouses of their neighbours; and therefore
their suffering a man to visit their wives in
the character of a cavaliero servente, is in
effect conniving at their own cuckoldom.
But this does not follow as an absolute
consequence; for men have a wonderful
faculty of deceiving themselves on such occasions.
So great is the infatuation of
their vanity, that the same degree of complaisance,
which they consider as the effect
of a very natural and excusable weakness,
when indulged by any woman for themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
they would look on as a horrible
enormity if admitted by their wives for
another man; so that whatever degree of
licentiousness may exist in consequence of
this system, I am convinced the majority
of husbands make exceptions in their own
favour, and that their ladies find means to
satisfy each individual that he is not involved
in a calamity, which, after all, is
more general in other countries, as well as
Italy, than it ought.</p>

<p>Even when there is the greatest harmony
and love between the husband and wife,
and although each would prefer the other’s
company to any other, still, such is the
tyranny of fashion, they must separate
every evening; he to play the cavaliero
servente to another woman, and she to be
led about by another man. Notwithstanding
this inconveniency, the couples who
are in this predicament are certainly happier
than those whose affections are not
centered at home. Some very loving couples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
lament the cruelty of this separation, yet
the world in general seem to be of opinion,
that a man and his wife who dine
together every day, and lie together every
night, may, with a proper exertion of philosophy,
be able to support being asunder a
few hours in the evening.</p>

<p>The Cicisbeo, in many instances, is a
poor relation or humble friend, who, not
being in circumstances to support an equipage,
is happy to be admitted into all the
societies, and to be carried about to public
diversions, as an appendage to the lady. I
have known numbers of those gentlemen,
whose appearance and bodily infirmities
carried the clearest refutation, with
respect to themselves personally, of the
scandalous stories of an improper connection
between cavaliero serventes and their
mistresses. I never in my life saw men
more happily formed, both in body and
mind, for saving the reputation of the females
with whom they were on a footing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
of intimacy. The humble and timid air
which many of them betray in the presence
of the ladies, and the perseverance
with which they continue their services,
notwithstanding the contemptuous stile in
which they are often treated, is equally
unlike the haughtiness natural to favoured
lovers, and the indifference of men satiated
with enjoyment.</p>

<p>There are, it must be confessed, Cicisbeos
of a very different stamp, whose figure and
manners might be supposed more agreeable
to the ladies they serve, than to their lords.
I once expressed my surprise, that a particular
person permitted one of this description
to attend his wife. I was told, by way
of solution of my difficulty, that the husband
was poor, and the Cicisbeo rich. It
is not in Italy only where infamous compromises
of this nature take place.</p>

<p>I have also known instances, since I have
been in this country, where the characters
of the ladies were so well established, as not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
to be shaken either in the opinion of their
acquaintances or husbands, although their
cavaliero serventes were in every respect
agreeable and accomplished.</p>

<p>But whether the connection between
them is supposed innocent or criminal, most
Englishmen will be astonished how men
can pass so much of their time with women.
This, however, will appear less
surprising, when they recollect that the
Italian nobility dare not intermeddle in politics;
can find no employment in the army
or navy; and that there are no such amusements
in the country as hunting or drinking.
In such a situation, if a man of fortune
has no turn for gaming, what can he
do? Even an Englishman, in those desperate
circumstances, might be driven to the
company and conversation of women, to
lighten the burden of time. The Italians
have persevered so long in this expedient,
that, however extraordinary it may seem
to those who have never tried it, there can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
be no doubt that they find it to succeed.
They tell you, that nothing so effectually
sooths the cares, and beguiles the tediousness
of life, as the company of an agreeable
woman; that though the intimacy
should never exceed the limits of friendship,
there is something more flattering
and agreeable in it than in male friendships;
that they find the female heart more
sincere, less interested, and warmer in its
attachments; that women in general have
more delicacy, and—. Well, well, all
this may be true, you will say; but may
not a man enjoy all these advantages, to as
great perfection, by an intimacy and friendship
with his own wife, as with his neighbour’s?
“Non, Monsieur, point du tout,”
answered a Frenchman, to whom this question
was once addressed. “Et pourquoi
donc? Parceque cela n’est pas permis.”
This you will not think a very satisfactory
answer to so natural and so pertinent a
question—It is not the fashion! This,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
however, was the only answer I received
all over Italy.</p>

<p>This system is unknown to the middle
and lower ranks; they pass their time in
the exercise of their professions, and in the
society of their wives and children, as in
other countries; and in that sphere of life,
jealousy, which formed so strong a feature
of the Italian character, is still to be found
as strong as ever. He who attempts to
visit the wife or mistress of any of the
tradespeople without their permission, is
in no small danger of a Coltellata. I have
often heard it asserted, that Italian women
have remarkable powers of attaching their
lovers. Those powers, whatever they are,
do not seem to depend entirely on personal
charms, as many of them retain their ancient
influence over their lovers after their
beauty is much in the wane, and they
themselves are considerably advanced in the
vale of years. I know an Italian nobleman,
of great fortune, who has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
lately married to a very beautiful young
woman, and yet he continues his assiduity
to his former mistress, now an old woman,
as punctually as ever. I know an Englishman
who is said to be in the same situation,
with this difference, that his lady is still
more beautiful. In both these instances, it
is natural to believe that the beautiful young
wives will always take care to keep their
husbands in such a chaste and virtuous way
of thinking, that, whatever time they may
spend with their ancient mistresses, nothing
criminal will ever pass between them.</p>

<p>Whatever satisfaction the Italians find in
this kind of constancy, and in their friendly
attachments to one woman, my friend the
Marquis de F—— told me, when I last
saw him at Paris, that he had tried it while
he remained at Rome, and found it quite
intolerable. A certain obliging ecclesiastic
had taken the trouble, at the earnest request
of a lady of that city, to arrange matters
between her and the Marquis, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
was put into immediate possession of all the
rights that were ever supposed to belong to
a Cicisbeo. The woman nauseated her
husband, which had advanced matters
mightily; and her passion for the Marquis
was in proportion to her abhorrence of
the other. In this state things had remained
but a very short time, when the
Marquis called one afternoon to drive the
Abbé out a little into the country, but he
happened to have just dined. The meals
or this ecclesiastic were generally rather
oppressive for two or three hours after they
were finished; he therefore declined the invitation,
saying, by way of apology, “Je
suis dans les horreurs de la digestion.”
He then enquired how the Marquis’s amour
went on with the lady. “Ah, pour l’amour,
cela est à peu près passé,” replied the
Marquis, “et nous sommes actuellement
dans les horreurs de l’amitié.”</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXVI">LETTER LXXVI.</h2>

<p class="right">Florence.</p>

<p>The Florentines imputed the decay of
the republic to the circumstance of
their Sovereign residing in another country;
and they imagined, that wealth would
accumulate all over Tuscany, and flow into
Florence, from various quarters, as soon as
they should have a residing Prince, and a
Court established. It appears, that their
hopes were too sanguine, or at least premature.
Commerce is still in a languid
condition, in spite of all the pains taken by
the Great Duke to revive it.</p>

<p>The Jews are not held in that degree of
odium, or subjected to the same humiliating
distinctions here, as in most other cities of
Europe. I am told, some of the richest
merchants are of that religion. Another
class of mankind, who are also reprobated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
in some countries, are in this looked on in
the same light with other citizens. I mean
the actors and singers at the different
Theatres. Why Christians, in any country,
should have the same prejudice against
them as against Jews, many are at a loss to
know; it cannot, certainly, be on the same
account. Actors and actresses have never
been accused of an obstinate, or superstitious
adherence to the principles or ceremonies
of any <i>false religion</i> whatever.</p>

<p>To attempt a description of the churches,
palaces, and other public buildings, would
lead, in my opinion, to a very unentertaining
detail. Few cities, of its size, in
Europe, however, afford so fine a field of
amusement to those who are fond of such
subjects; though the lovers of architecture
will be shocked to find several of the finest
churches without fronts, which, according
to some, is owing to a real deficiency of
money; while others assert, they are left
in this condition, as a pretext for levying
contributions to finish them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>The chapel of St. Lorenzo is, perhaps,
the finest and most expensive habitation
that ever was reared for the dead; it is
encrusted with precious stones, and adorned
by the workmanship of the best modern
sculptors. Some complain that, after all,
it has a gloomy appearance. There seems
to be no impropriety in that, considering
what the building was intended for;
though, certainly, the same effect might
have been produced at less expence. Mr.
Addison remarked, that this chapel advanced
so very slowly, that it is not impossible
but the family of Medicis may be
extinct before their burial-place is finished.
This has actually taken place: the Medici
family is extinct, and the chapel remains
still unfinished.</p>

<p>Of all the methods by which the vanity
of the Great has distinguished them from
the rest of mankind, this of erecting splendid
receptacles for their bones, excites the
least envy. The sight of the most superb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
edifice of this kind, never drew a repining
sigh from the bosom of one poor person;
nor do the unsuccessful complain, that the
bodies of Fortune’s favourites rot under
Parian marble, while their own will, in all
probability, be allowed to moulder beneath
a plain turf.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the number of
statues which ornament the streets and
squares of Florence, and how much they
are respected by the common people. I
am told, they amount in all to above one
hundred and fifty, many of them of exquisite
workmanship, and admired by
those of the best taste. Such a number of
statues, without any drapery, continually
exposed to the public eye, with the far
greater number of pictures, as well as statues,
in the same state, to be seen in the
palaces, have produced, in both sexes, the
most perfect insensibility to nudities.</p>

<p>Ladies who have remained some time at
Rome and Florence, particularly those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
affect a taste for virtù, acquire an intrepidity
and a cool minuteness, in examining
and criticising naked figures, which is unknown
to those who have never passed the
Alps. There is something in the figure of
the God of Gardens, which is apt to alarm
the modesty of a novice; but I have heard
of female dilettantes who minded it no
more than a straw.</p>

<p>The Palazzo Pitti, where the Great
Duke resides, is on the opposite side of the
Arno from the Gallery. It has been enlarged
since it was purchased from the
ruined family of Pitti. The furniture of
this palace is rich and curious, particularly
some tables of Florentine work, which are
much admired. The most precious ornaments,
however, are the paintings. The
walls of what is called the Imperial Chamber,
are painted in fresco, by various
painters; the subjects are allegorical, and
in honour of Lorenzo of Medicis, distinguished
by the name of the Magnificent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
There is more fancy than taste displayed in
those paintings. The other principal rooms
are distinguished by the names of Heathen
Deities, as Jupiter, Apollo, Mars, Venus,
and by paintings in fresco, mostly by
Pietro da Cortona. In the last mentioned,
the subjects are different from what is naturally
expected from the name of the
room, being representations of the triumphs
of Virtue over Love, or some memorable
instance of continency. As the Medici
family have been more distinguished for the
protection they afforded the arts, than for
the virtues of continency or self-denial,
it is probable, the subject, as well as the
execution of these pieces, was left entirely
to the painter.</p>

<p>I happened lately to be at this palace,
with a person who is perfectly well acquainted
with all the pictures of any merit
in Florence. While he explained the peculiar
excellencies of Pietro’s manner, a
gentleman in company, who, although he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
does not pretend to the smallest skill in
pictures, would rather remain ignorant for
ever, than listen to the lectures of a connoisseur,
walked on, by himself, into the
other apartments, while I endeavoured to
profit by my instructor’s knowledge. When
the other gentleman returned, he said, “I
know no more of painting than my
pointer; but there is a picture in one of
the other rooms, which I would rather
have than all those you seem to admire
so much; it is the portrait of a healthy,
handsome, country woman, with her
child in her arms. There is nothing interesting
in the subject, to be sure, because
none of us are personally acquainted
with the woman. But I cannot
help thinking the colours very natural.
The young woman’s countenance
is agreeable, and expressive of fondness
and the joy of a mother over a
first-born. The child is a robust, chubby-cheeked
fellow; such as the son of
a peasant should be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>We followed him into the room, and
the picture which pleased him so much, was
the famous Madonna della Seggiola of Raphael.
Our instructor immediately called
out Viva! and pronounced him a man of
genuine taste; because, without any previous
knowledge or instruction, he had
fixed his admiration on the finest picture
in Florence. But this gentleman, as soon
as he understood what the picture was,
disclaimed all title to praise; “because,”
said he, “although, when I considered
that picture, simply as the representation
of a blooming country wench hugging
her child, I admired the art of the
painter, and thought it one of the truest
copies of nature I ever saw; yet, I confess,
my admiration is much abated,
now that you inform me his intention
was to represent the Virgin Mary.”
“Why so?” replied the Cicerone; “the
Virgin Mary was not of higher rank.
She was but a poor woman, living in a
little village in Galilee.” “No rank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
in life,” said the other, “could give
additional dignity to the person who
had been told by an Angel from heaven,
that she had found favour with God;
that her Son should be called the Son of
the Highest; and who, herself, was conscious
of all the miraculous circumstances
attending his conception and birth. In
the countenance of such a woman, besides
comeliness, and the usual affection
of a mother, I looked for the most lively
expression of admiration, gratitude,
virgin modesty, and divine love. And
when I am told, the picture is by the
greatest painter that ever lived, I am
disappointed in perceiving no traces of
that kind in it.” What justice there is
in this gentleman’s remarks, I leave it to
better judges than I pretend to be, to
determine.</p>

<p>After our diurnal visit to the Gallery,
we often pass the rest of the forenoon in
the gardens belonging to this palace. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
vale of Arno; the gay hills that surround
it; and other natural beauties to be viewed
from thence, form an agreeable variety,
even to eyes which have been feasting on
the most exquisite beauties of art. The
pleasure arising from both, however, diminishes
by repetition; but may be again
excited by the admiration of a new spectator,
of whose taste and sensibility you have
a good opinion. I experienced this on the
arrival of Mr. F——r, a gentleman of
sense, honour, and politeness, whose company
gave fresh relish to our other enjoyments
in this place. It is now some time
since he left us; and I am not at all unhappy
in the thoughts of proceeding, in a
day or two, to Bologna, in our road to
Milan.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXVII">LETTER LXXVII.</h2>

<p class="right">Milan.</p>

<p>For a post or two after leaving Florence,
and about as much before
you arrive at Bologna, the road is very
agreeable; the rest of your journey between
those two cities is over the sandy
Apennines.</p>

<p>We had the good fortune to find at
Bologna Sir William and Lady H——,
Mr. F——t, Mr. K——, Lord L——,
and Sir H—— F——n. Our original
intention was to have proceeded without
delay to Milan, but on such an agreeable
meeting it was impossible not to remain a
few days at Bologna.</p>

<p>I went to the academy on the day of
distributing the prizes for the best specimens
and designs in painting, sculpture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
and architecture; a discourse in praise of
the fine arts was pronounced by one of
the professors, who took that opportunity
of enumerating the fine qualities of the
Cardinal Legate; none of the virtues,
great or small, were omitted on the occasion;
all were attributed in the superlative degree
to this accomplished prince of the church.
The learned orator acknowledged, however,
that this panegyric did not properly
belong to his subject, but hoped
that the audience, and particularly the
Legate himself, who was present, would
forgive him, in consideration that the
eulogy had been wrung from him by the
irresistible force of truth. The same force
drew forth something similar in praise of
the Gonfalonier and other magistrates who
were present also; and what you may
think very remarkable, the number and
importance of the qualities attributed to
those distinguished persons kept an exact
proportion with their <i>rank</i>. Power
in this happy city seems to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
weighed in the scales of justice, and distributed
by the hand of wisdom. All the
inferior magistrates, we were informed,
are very worthy men, endowed with many
excellent qualities; the Gonfalonier has
many more, and the Legate possesses every
virtue under the sun. If the Pope had
entered the room, the too lavish professor
would not have been able to help him to
a single morsel of praise which had not
been already served up.</p>

<p>This town is at present quite full of
strangers, who came to assist at the procession
of Corpus Domini. The Duke of
Parma, several Cardinals, and other persons
of high distinction, besides a prodigious
crowd of citizens, attended this
great festival. The streets through which
the Host was carried under a magnificent
canopy, were adorned with tapestry,
paintings, looking-glasses, and all the
various kinds of finery which the inhabitants
could produce. Many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
paintings seemed unsuitable to the occasion;
they were on profane, and some of
them on wanton subjects; and it appeared
extraordinary to see the figures of Venus,
Minerva, Apollo, Jupiter, and others of
that abdicated family, arranged along the
walls in honour of a triumph of the Corpus
Christi.</p>

<p>On our way to Milan we stopped a
short time at Modena, the capital of the
duchy of that name. The whole duchy
is about fifty miles in length, and twenty-six
in breadth; the town contains twenty
thousand inhabitants; the streets are in
general large, straight, and ornamented
with porticoes. This city is surrounded
by a fortification, and farther secured by
a citadel; it was anciently rendered famous
by the siege which Decimus Brutus
sustained here against Marc Antony.</p>

<p>We proceeded next to Parma, a beautiful
town, considerably larger than Modena,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
and defended, like it, by a citadel and regular
fortification. The streets are well
built, broad, and regular. The town is
divided unequally by the little river Parma,
which loses itself in the Po, ten or twelve
miles from this city.</p>

<p>The theatre is the largest of any in Europe;
and consequently a great deal larger
than there is any occasion for. Every body
has observed, that it is so favourable to the
voice, that a whisper from the stage is heard
all over this immense house; but nobody
tells us on what circumstance in the construction
this surprising effect depends.</p>

<p>The Modenese was the native country of
Correggio, but he passed most of his life at
Parma. Several of the churches are ornamented
by the pencil of that great artist,
particularly the cupola of the cathedral;
the painting of which has been so greatly
admired for the grandeur of the design and
the boldness of the fore-shortenings. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
now spoiled in such a manner, that its
principal beauties are not easily distinguished.</p>

<p>Some of the best pictures in the Ducal
Palace have been removed to Naples and
elsewhere; but the famous picture of the
Virgin, in which Mary Magdalen and St.
Jerom are introduced, still remains. In
this composition, Correggio has been thought
to have united, in a supreme degree, beauties
which are seldom found in the same
piece; an excellence in any one of which
has been sufficient to raise other artists to
celebrity. The same connoisseurs assert,
that this picture is equally worthy of admiration,
on account of the freshness of the
colouring, the inexpressible gracefulness of
the design, and the exquisite tenderness of
the expression. After I had heard all those
fine things said over and over again, I
thought I had nothing to do but admire;
and I had prepared my mind accordingly.—Would
to Heaven that the respectable body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
of connoisseurs were agreed in opinion, and
I should most readily submit mine to theirs!
But while the above eulogium still resounded
in my ears, other connoisseurs have asserted,
that this picture is full of affectation; that
the shadowing is of a dirty brown, the attitude
of the Magdalen constrained and unnatural;
that she may strive to the end of
time without ever being able to kiss the
foot of the infant Jesus in her present position;
that she has the look of an ideot;
and that the Virgin herself is but a vulgar
figure, and seems not a great deal wiser;
that the angels have a ridiculous simper,
and most abominable air of affectation;
and finally, that St. Jerom has the appearance
of a sturdy beggar, who intrudes his
brawny figure where it has no right to be.</p>

<p>Distracted with such opposite sentiments,
what can a plain man do, who has no great
reliance on his own judgment, and wishes
to give offence to neither party? I shall
leave the picture as I found it, to answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
for itself, with a single remark in favour
of the angels. I cannot take upon me to
say how the real angels of heaven look; but
I certainly have seen some <i>earthly</i> angels, of
my acquaintance, assume the simper and
air of those in this picture, when they
wished to appear quite celestial.</p>

<p>The duchies of Modena, Parma, and
Placentia, are exceedingly fertile. The soil
is naturally rich, and the climate being
moister here than in many other parts of
Italy, produces more plentiful pasturage for
cattle. The road runs over a continued
plain, among meadows and corn fields,
divided by rows of trees, from whose
branches the vines hang in beautiful festoons.
We had the pleasure of thinking,
as we drove along, that the peasants are
not deprived of the blessings of the smiling
fertility among which they live. They
had in general a neat, contented, and cheerful
appearance. The women are successfully
attentive to the ornaments of dress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
which is never the case amidst oppressive
poverty.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fertility of the
country around it, the town of Placentia itself
is but thinly inhabited, and seems to
be in a state of decay. What first strike a
stranger on entering this city, are two
equestrian statues, in bronze, by Giovanni
di Bologna; they stand in the principal
square, before the Town-house. The best
of the two represents that consummate general
Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma
and Placentia, who commanded the army
of Philip II. in the Netherlands. The inscription
on the pedestal mentions his having
relieved the city of Paris, when called to
the assistance of the League into France,
where his great military skill, and cool intrepidity,
enabled him to baffle all the ardent
impetuosity of the gallant Henry. He
was certainly worthy of a better master,
and of serving in a better cause. We cannot,
without regret, behold a Prince, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
the Duke of Parma’s talents and character,
supporting the pride of an unrelenting tyrant,
and the rancour of furious fanatics.</p>

<p>Except the Ducal Palace, and some pictures
in the churches, which I dare swear
you will cordially forgive me for passing
over undescribed, I believe there is not a
great deal in this city worthy of attention;
at all events I can say little about them, as
we remained here only a few hours during
the heat of the day, and set out the same
evening for Milan.</p>

<p>Milan, the ancient capital of Lombardy,
is the largest city in Italy,
except Rome; but though it is thought
rather to exceed Naples in size, it does not
contain above one-half the number of inhabitants.</p>

<p>The cathedral stands in the centre of the
city, and, after St. Peter’s, is the most considerable
building in Italy. It ought by
this time to be the largest in the world, if
what they tell us be true, that it is near
four hundred years since it was begun, and
that there has been a considerable number
of men daily employed in completing it
ever since; but as the injuries which time
does to the ancient parts of the fabric keep
them in constant employment, without the
possibility of their work being ever completed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
Martial’s epigram, on the barber
Eutrapelus, has been applied to them with
great propriety. That poor man, it seems,
performed his operations so very slowly,
that the beards of his patients required
shaving again on the side where he had begun,
by the time he had finished the other.</p>

<p class="center">EUTRAPELUS TONSOR DUM CIRCUIT ORA LUPERCI,<br />

<p>No church in Christendom is so much loaded,
I had almost said disfigured, with ornaments.
The number of statues, withinside
and without, is prodigious; they are
all of marble, and many of them finely
wrought. The greater part cannot be distinctly
seen from below, and therefore
certainly have nothing to do above. Besides
those which are of a size, and in a situation
to be distinguished from the street, there
are great numbers of smaller statues, like
fairies peeping from every cornice, and hid
among the grotesque ornaments, which are
here in vast profusion. They must have
cost much labour to the artists who formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
them, and are still a source of toil to strangers,
who, in compliment to the person
who harangues on the beauties of this
church, which he says is the eighth wonder
of the world, are obliged to ascend to the
roof to have a nearer view of them.</p>

<p>This vast fabric is not simply encrusted,
which is not uncommon in Italy, but intirely
built of solid white marble, and supported
by fifty columns, said to be eighty-four
feet high. The four pillars under the
cupola, are twenty-eight feet in circumference.
By much the finest statue belonging
to it is that of St. Bartholomew. He
appears flayed, with his skin flung around
his middle like a sash, and in the easiest
and most degagé manner imaginable. The
muscles are well expressed; and the figure
might be placed with great propriety in the
hall of an anatomist; but, exposed as it is
to the view of people of all professions,
and of both sexes, it excites more disgust
and horror than admiration. Like those
beggars who uncover their sores in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
street, the artist has destroyed the very effect
he meant to produce. This would have
sufficiently evinced that the statue was not
the work of Praxitiles, without the inscription
on the pedestal.</p>

<p class="center">NON ME PRAXITILES, SED MARCUS FINXIT AGRATI.</p>

<p>The inside of the choir is ornamented by
some highly esteemed sculpture in wood.
From the roof hangs a case of crystal, surrounded
by rays of gilt metal, and inclosing
a nail, said to be one of those by
which our Saviour was nailed to the cross.
The treasury belonging to this church is
reckoned the richest in Italy, after that of
Loretto. It is composed of jewels, relics,
and curiosities of various kinds; but what
is esteemed above all the rest, is a small
portion of Aaron’s rod, which is carefully
preserved there.</p>

<p>The Ambrosian Library is said to be one
of the most valuable collections of books
and manuscripts in Europe. It is open a
certain number of hours every day; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
there are accommodations for those who
come to read or make extracts.</p>

<p>In the Museum, adjoining to the Library,
are a considerable number of pictures,
and many natural curiosities. Among
these they shew a human skeleton. This
does not excite a great deal of attention,
till you are informed that it consists of the
bones of a Milanese Lady, of distinguished
beauty, who, by her last will, ordained that
her body should be dissected, and the skeleton
placed in this Museum, for the contemplation
of posterity. If this Lady only
meant to give a proof of the transient nature
of external charms, and that a beautiful
woman is not more desirable after
death than a homely one, she might have
allowed her body to be consigned to dust in
the usual way. In spite of all the cosmetics,
and other auxiliaries which vanity
employs to varnish and support decaying
beauty and flaccid charms, the world have
been long satisfied that death is not necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
to put the fair and the homely on a
level; a very few years, even during life,
do the business.</p>

<p>There is no place in Italy, perhaps I
might have said in Europe, where strangers
are received in such an easy, hospitable
manner, as at Milan. Formerly the Milanese
Nobility displayed a degree of splendour
and magnificence, not only in their
entertainments, but in their usual style of
living, unknown in any other country in
Europe. They are under a necessity at present
of living at less expence, but they still
shew the same obliging and hospitable disposition.
This country having, not very
long since, been possessed by the French,
from whom it devolved to the Spaniards,
and from them to the Germans, the
troops of those nations have, at different
periods, had their residence here, and, in
the course of these vicissitudes, produced a
style of manners, and stamped a character
on the inhabitants of this duchy, different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
from what prevails in any other part of
Italy; and nice observers imagine they
perceive in Milanese manners the politeness,
formality, and honesty imputed to
those three nations, blended with the ingenuity
natural to Italians. Whatever uneasiness
the inhabitants of Milan may feel,
from the idea of their being under German
government, they seem universally pleased
with the personal character of Count Fermian,
who has resided here many years as
Minister from Vienna, equally to the satisfaction
of the Empress Queen, the inhabitants
of Milan, and the strangers who
occasionally travel this way.</p>

<p>The Great Theatre having been burnt to
the ground last year, there are no dramatic
entertainments, except at a small temporary
playhouse, which is little frequented; but
the company assemble every evening in
their carriages on the ramparts, and drive
about, in the same manner as at Naples,
till it is pretty late. In Italy, the ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
have no notion of quitting their carriages
at the public walks, and using their own
legs, as in England and France. On seeing
the number of servants, and the splendour
of the equipages which appear every
evening at the Corso on the ramparts, one
would not suspect that degree of depopulation,
and diminution of wealth, which we
are assured has taken place within these few
years all over the Milanese; and which,
according to my information, proceeds
from the burthensome nature of some late
taxes, and the insolent and oppressive manner
in which they are gathered.</p>

<p>The natural productions of this fertile
country must occasion a considerable commerce,
by the exportation of grain, particularly
rice; cattle, cheese, and by the
various manufactures of silken and velvet
stuffs, stockings, handkerchiefs, ribands,
gold and silver laces and embroideries,
woollen and linen cloths, as well as by
some large manufactures of glass, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
earthen ware in imitation of china, which
are established here. But I am told monopolies
are too much protected here, and that
prejudices against the profession of a merchant
still exist in the minds of the only
people who have money. These cannot fail
to check industry, and depress the soul of
commerce; and perhaps there is little probability
that the inhabitants of Milan will
overcome this unfortunate turn of mind
while they remain under German dominion,
and adopt German ideas. The peasants,
though more at their ease than in
many other places, yet are not so much so
as might be expected in so very fertile a
country. Why are the inhabitants of the
rich plains of Lombardy, where Nature
pours forth her gifts in such profusion,
less opulent than those of the mountains of
Switzerland? Because Freedom, whose influence
is more benign than sunshine and
zephyrs, who covers the rugged rock with
soil, drains the sickly swamp, and clothes
the brown heath in verdure; who dresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
the labourer’s face with smiles, and makes
him behold his increasing family with delight
and exultation; Freedom has abandoned
the fertile fields of Lombardy, and
dwells among the mountains of Switzerland.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXIX">LETTER LXXIX.</h2>

<p class="right">Chamberry.</p>

<p>We made so short a stay at Turin
that I did not think of writing
from thence. I shall now give you a
sketch of our progress since my last.</p>

<p>We left Milan at midnight, and arrived
the next evening at Turin before the
shutting of the gates. All the approaches
to that city are magnificent. It is situated
at the bottom of the Alps, in a fine plain
watered by the Po. Most of the streets
are well built, uniform, clean, straight,
and terminating on some agreeable object.
The Strada di Po, leading to the
palace, the finest and largest in the city,
is adorned with porticoes equally beautiful
and convenient. The four gates are also
highly ornamental. There can be no
more agreeable walk than that around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
ramparts. The fortifications are regular
and in good repair, and the citadel is
reckoned one of the strongest in Europe.
The royal palace and the gardens are admired
by some. The apartments display
neatness, rather than magnificence. The
rooms are small, but numerous. The furniture
is rich and elegant; even the floors
attract attention, and must peculiarly strike
strangers who come from Rome and Bologna;
they are curiously inlaid with various
kinds of wood, and kept always in
a state of shining brightness. The pictures,
statues, and antiquities in the palace
are of great value; of the former there
are some by the greatest masters, but
those of the Flemish school predominate.</p>

<p>No royal family in Europe are more
rigid observers of the laws of etiquette,
than that of Sardinia; all their movements
are uniform and invariable. The
hour of rising, of going to mass, of taking
the air; every thing is regulated like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
clock-work. Those illustrious persons
must have a vast fund of natural good-humour,
to enable them to persevere in such
a wearisome routine, and support their
spirits under such a continued weight of
oppressive formality.</p>

<p>We had the satisfaction of seeing them
all at mass; but as the D—— of H——
grows more impatient to get to England
the nearer we approach it, he declined
being presented at court, and we left
Turin two days after our arrival.</p>

<p>We stopped a few hours, during the
heat of the day, at a small village, called
St. Ambrose, two or three posts from
Turin. I never experienced more intense
heat than during this day, while we were
tantalized with a view of the snow on the
top of the Alps, which seem to overhang
this place, though, in reality, they are
some leagues distant. While we remained
at St. Ambrose there was a grand procession.
All the men, women, and children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
who were able to crawl, attended;
several old women carried crucifixes, others
pictures of the saint, or flags fixed to the
ends of long poles; they seemed to have
some difficulty in wielding them, yet the
good old women tottered along as happy
as so many young ensigns the first time
they bend under the regimental colours.
Four men, carrying a box upon their
shoulders, walked before the rest. I asked
what the box contained, and was informed
by a sagacious looking old man, that it
contained the bones of St. John. I enquired
if all the Saint’s bones were there;
he assured me, that not even a joint of his
little finger was wanting; “Because,” continued
I, “I have seen a considerable
number of bones in different parts of
Italy, which are said to be the bones of
St. John.” He smiled at my simplicity,
and said the world was full of imposition;
but nothing could be more certain, than
that those in the box were the true bones
of the Saint; he had remembered them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
ever since he was a child—and his father,
when on his death-bed, had told him, on
the <i>word of a dying man</i>, That they belonged
to St. John and no other body.</p>

<p>At Novalezza, a village at the bottom
of Mount Cenis, our carriages were taken
to pieces, and delivered to Muleteers to be
carried to Lanebourg. I had bargained
with the Vitturino, before we left Turin,
for our passage over the mountain in the
chairs commonly used on such occasions.
The fellow had informed us there was no
possibility of going in any other manner;
but when we came to this place, I saw no
difficulty in being carried up by mules,
which we all preferred, to the great satisfaction
of our knavish conductor, who thereby
saved the expence of one half the
chairmen, for whose labour he was already
paid.</p>

<p>We rode up this mountain, which has
been described in such formidable terms,
with great ease. At the top there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
fine verdant plain of five or six miles in
length, we halted at an Inn, called Santa
Croce, where Piedmont ends and Savoy
begins. Here we were regaled with fried
trout, catched in a large lake within sight,
from which the river Doria arises, which
runs to Turin in conjunction with the Po.
Though we ascend no higher than this
plain, which is the summit of Mount
Cenis, the mountains around are much
higher; in passing the plain we felt the
air so keen, that we were glad to have recourse
to our great-coats; which, at the
bottom of the hill, we had considered as a
very superfluous part of our baggage. I
had a great deal of conversation in passing
the mountain with a poor boy, who accompanied
us from Novalezza to take back
the mules; he told me he could neither
read nor write, and had never been farther
than Suza on one side of the mountain,
and Lanebourg on the other. He
spoke four languages, Piedmontese, which
is his native language; this is a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
Patois very different from Italian; the Patois
of the peasants of Savoy, which is
equally different from French; he also
spoke Italian and French wonderfully
well; the second he had learnt from the
Savoyard chairmen, and the two last from
Italian and French travellers whom he
has accompanied over Mount Cenis, where
he has passed his life hitherto, and which
he seems to have no desire of leaving. If
you chance to be consulted by any parent
who inclines to send their sons abroad
merely that they may be removed from
London, and acquire modern languages in
the most œconomical manner, you now
know what place to recommend. In none
where opportunities for this branch of
education are equal, is living cheaper than
at Mount Cenis, and I know nothing in
which it has any resemblance to London,
except that it stands on much the same
quantity of ground. I asked this boy,
why he did not learn English.—He
had all the inclination in the world.—“Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
don’t you learn it then as well as
French?” “On attrape le François,
Monsieur, bon gré, mal gré,” answered
he, “mais Messieurs les Anglois parlent
peu.”</p>

<p>When we arrived at the North side of the
mountain we dismissed our mules, and had
recourse to our Alpian chairs and chairmen.
The chairs are constructed in the simplest
manner, and perfectly answer the purpose
for which they are intended. The chairmen
are strong-made, nervous, little fellows.
One of them was betrothed to a
girl at Lanebourg, and was to be married
that evening. I could not, in conscience,
permit him to have any part in
carrying me, but directly appointed him
to Jack’s chair. The young fellow presented
us all with ribbons, which we wore in
our hats in honour of the bride. “Are
you very fond of your mistress, friend,”
said I? “Il faut que je l’aime beaucoup,”
answered he, “puisque, pauvre garçon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
comme me voila, je donne trente livres
au prêtre pour nous marier.” To tax
matrimony, and oblige the people who <i>beget
and maintain</i> children to pay to those who
<i>maintain</i> none, seems bad policy; and it
is surprising that a prince who attends so
minutely, as his Sardinian Majesty, to the
welfare of his subjects, does not remedy so
great an abuse.</p>

<p>As our carriers jogged zig-zag, according
to the course of the road, down the
mountain, they laughed and sung all the
way. “How comes it,” said I to the
D——, “that chairmen are generally
merrier than those they carry? To hear
these fellows without seeing them, one
would imagine that <i>we</i> had the laborious
part, while <i>they</i> sat at their ease.”
“True,” answered he; “and the same
person might conclude, on hearing the
bridegroom sing so cheerfully, that we
were just going to be married and not
he.” We arrived in a short time at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
the Inn at Lanebourg, nothing having
surprised me so much in the passage of
this mountain, the difficulty and danger
of which has been greatly exaggerated by
travellers, as the facility with which we
achieved it.</p>

<p>As soon as the scattered members of our
carriages were joined together, we proceeded
on our journey. The road is never
level, but a continued ascent and descent
along the side of high mountains. We
sometimes saw villages situated at a vast
height above us; at other times they were
seen with difficulty in the vales, at an immense
depth below us. The village of
Modane stands in a hollow, surrounded by
stupendous mountains. It began to grow
dark when we descended from a great
height into this hollow; we could only
perceive the rugged summits, and sides of
the mountains which encircle the village,
but not the village itself, or any part of the
plain at the bottom; we therefore seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
descending from the surface, by a dark
abyss leading to the centre of the globe.
We arrived safe at Modane, however, for
the road is good in every respect, steepness
excepted. Next morning we continued
our course, by a miserable place called La
Chambre, to Aiguebelle, a village of much
the same description. According to some
authors, this was the road by which Hannibal
led his army into Italy. They assert,
that the plain at the summit of Mount Cenis
was the place where he rested his army for
four days, and from which he showed his
soldiers the fertile plains of Italy, and encouraged
them to persevere: others assert
that he led his army into Italy by Mount
St. Bernard. This is a discussion into
which I am not qualified to enter; but
M——r G——l M——l, a gentleman of learning,
probity, and great professional merit,
in his way to Italy, where he now is, endeavoured
to trace the route of the Carthaginian
army with great attention; and imagines
he has been successful in his researches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
He has also ascertained the spots
on which some of the most memorable battles
were fought, by carefully comparing
the description of Polybius, and other authors,
with the fields of battle, and has
detected many mistakes, which have prevailed
on this curious subject; every where
supporting his own hypothesis by arguments
which none but one who has carefully
perused the various authors, and examined
the ground with a soldier’s eye,
could adduce. The same gentleman has
likewise made some observations relating to
the arms of the ancient Romans, and their
tactics in general, which are equally new
and ingenious, and which, it is hoped, he
will in due time give to the public.</p>

<p>We arrived at the inn at Aiguebelle just
in time to avoid an excessive storm of thunder
and rain, which lasted with great violence
through the whole night. Those
who have never heard thunder in a very
mountainous country, can form no idea of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
the loudness, repetition, and length of the
peals we heard this night. Many of the
inhabitants of those mountains have never
seen better houses than their own huts, or
any other country than the Alps. What a
rugged, boisterous piece of work must they
take this world to be!</p>

<p>I fancy you have by this time had
enough of mountains and vallies, so if you
please we shall skip over Montmelian to
Chamberry, where we arrived the same day
on which we left Aiguebelle. To-morrow
we shall sleep at Geneva. I did not expect
much sleep this night from the thoughts of
it, and therefore have sat up almost till
day-break writing this letter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXX">LETTER LXXX.</h2>

<p class="right">Besançon.</p>

<p>The D—— of H—— went some
weeks ago to visit an acquaintance in
one of the provinces of France. As I inclined
rather to pass that time at Geneva,
we agreed to meet at Paris, whither Jack
and I are thus far on our way.</p>

<p>I must now fairly confess that I found
myself so happy with my kind friends the
Genevois, that I could not spare an hour
from their company to write to you or any
correspondent, unless on indispensable business.
I might also plead, that you yourself
have been in some measure the cause of
my being seduced from my pen. In your
last letter; which I found waiting for me at
the post-house at Geneva, you mention a
late publication in terms that gave me a curiosity
to see it; and an English gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
who had the only copy which has as yet
reached that city, was so obliging as to
lend it me. The hours which I usually
allot to sleep, were all I had in my power
to pass alone; and they were very considerably
abridged by this admirable performance.
The extensive reading there
displayed, the perspicuity with which historical
facts are related, the new light in
which many of them are placed, the depth
of the reflections, and the dignity and nervous
force of the language, all announce
the hand of a master. If the author lives
to complete his arduous undertaking, he
will do more to dissipate the historical darkness
which overshadows the middle ages,
give a clearer <i>History of the Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire</i>, and fill up, in a
more satisfactory manner, the long interval
between ancient and modern history,
than all the writers who have preceded
him. This accounts for my long silence.
You see I resume my pen the very first opportunity,
after the causes I have assigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
for it are removed, which ought to give
the more weight to my apology.</p>

<p>As I have frequently been at Lyons, I
chose, on this occasion, to return to Paris
by Franche Comté and Champagne. We
accordingly set out very early yesterday
morning, and were by no means in high
spirits when we left Geneva, and passed
along the side of the lake, through the Pais
de Vaud. The beauties of that country,
though they astonish at first sight, yet, like
the characters of the inhabitants, they improve
on intimacy. Every time I have
looked at the lake of Geneva, and its delightful
environs, I have discovered something
new to admire. As I entered the
Canton of Bern, I often turned about, and
at last withdrew my eyes from those favourite
objects, with an emotion similar to
what you feel on taking leave of a friend,
whom you have reason to think you shall
never see again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>The first place we came to, on entering
France from the Canton of Bern, is a poor
little town on an hill; I forget its name.
While the postillion stopped to put something
to rights about the harness, I stepped
into a shop where they sold wooden shoes;
and in the course of my conversation with
a peasant, who had just purchased a pair for
himself, and another for his wife, he said,
“les Bernois sont bien à leur aise, Monsieur,
pendant que nous autres François
vivons tres durement, et cependant
les Bernois sont des hérétiques.” “Voilà,”
said an old woman, who sat in a corner
reading her breviary; “voilà,” said she,
taking off her spectacles, and laying her
beads on the book, “ce que je trouve incompréhensible.”</p>

<p>This was, however, at the extremity of
France, and in a province lately acquired;
for it must be confessed, that it is not common
for the French to imagine that any
country whatever has the advantage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
theirs in any one circumstance; and they
certainly are not so apt to grumble as some
of their neighbours, who have less reason.
When I was last at Geneva, a French hair-dresser—Let
me intreat you not to shew
this to your friend ——, who is so fond of
people of quality, that he thinks there is
no <i>life</i> out of their company. He would
pshaw, and curse my poor peasants, and
old women, and hair-dressers, and accuse
me of being too fond of such low company.</p>

<p>As for the old women, I am much mistaken
if there are not at least as many to
be found of both sexes in high life as in
low; for the others, I declare I have no
particular affection, but I am fond of strokes
of nature and character, and must look for
them where they are to be found. I introduce
the present hair-dresser to your acquaintance,
because, if I am not mistaken,
he spoke the sentiments of his whole nation,
high and low. You shall judge. This
young fellow attended me every morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
while I remained at Geneva; he had been
a year or two at London; and while he
dressed my hair, his tongue generally
moved as quick as his fingers. He was
full of his remarks upon London, and the
fine people whose hair he pretended to
have dressed. “Do you not think,” said
I, “that people may live very happily in
that country?” “Mais—pour cela oui,
Monsieur.” “Do you think, then, they
<i>are</i> happy?” “Pour cela, non, Monsieur.”
“Can you guess at the reason why they
are not, though they have so much reason
to be so?” “Oui, Monsieur, elle est toute
simple.” “Pray what is the reason they
are not happy?” “C’est, qu’ils ne font
pas destinés à l’être.”</p>

<p>A very genteel young man, a Genevois,
happened to call on me, for two minutes,
while this friseur was with me. The young
gentleman had passed some time at Paris,
and was dressed exactly in the Parisian
taste. “He has much the air of one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
your countrymen,” said I to the Frenchman,
as soon as the other had left the
room.</p>

<p>“Mon Dieu! quelle différence,” cried
the friseur. “For my part, I can see
none,” said I. “Monsieur,” resumed he,
“soyez persuadé qu’aucun Genevois ne sera
jamais pris pour un François.” “There
are certainly some <i>petit-maîtres</i> to be
found in this town,” said I. “Pardonnez
moi,” replied he, “ils ne sont que
petit-maîtres manqués.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see an Englishman,” said
I, “who might pass for a Frenchman?”
“Jamais de la vie, Monsieur!” replied he,
with an accent of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Suppose him,” said I, “a man of quality?”
“N’importe.”</p>

<p>“But,” continued I, “suppose he had
lived several years at Paris, that he was
naturally very handsome, and well made,
that he had been educated by the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
French dancing-master, his clothes made
by the best French taylor, and his hair
dressed by the most eminent friseur in
Paris?” “C’est beaucoup, Monsieur, mais
ce n’est pas assez.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed I, “would you still
know him to be an Englishman?” “Assurément,
Monsieur.”</p>

<p>“What! before he spoke?” “Au premier
coup d’œil, Monsieur.”</p>

<p>“The Devil you would; but how?”
“C’est que Messieurs les Anglois ont un
air—une manière de se présenter—un—que
sais-je moi—vous m’entendez bien,
Monsieur—un certain air si Gau—”</p>

<p>“Quel air maraud?” “Enfin un air
qui est charmant, si vous voulez, Monsieur,”
said he rapidly, “mais que le
Diable m’emporte si c’est l’air François.”</p>

<p>To-morrow I shall take a view of this
town, and proceed immediately after breakfast
to Paris: mean while I wish you very
heartily good night.</p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXXI">LETTER LXXXI.</h2>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>I Made a longer stay at Besançon than I
intended, and am now about to inform
you what detained me. The morning after
the date of my last, as I returned to the inn
from the parade, where I had been to see
the troops, I met a servant of the Marquis
de F——, who ran up to me the moment
he knew me, and, in a breath, told me,
that his master was at Besançon; that he
had been exceedingly ill, and thought, by
the physicians, in great danger; but his
complaint having terminated in an ague,
they had now the strongest hopes of his
recovery. I desired to be conducted immediately
to him.</p>

<p>I found the Marquis alone; pale, languid,
and greatly emaciated. He expressed,
however, equal pleasure and surprise at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
this unexpected visit; said, he had been in
danger of making a very long journey,
and added, with a smile, that no man had
ever set out with less inclination, for he
hated travelling alone, and this was the
only journey he could ever take, without
wishing some of his friends to accompany
him. He rejoiced, therefore, that he had
been recalled in time to meet me before
I should pass on to Paris. “But tell
me,” continued he, “for I have ten
thousand questions to ask—but let us
take things in order; Eh bien, donnez
nous donc des nouvélles du Pape? On
nous a dit que vous aviez passé par la ceremonie
de la Pantoufle. Ne pourroit
on pas pendre au tragique une misère
comme cela chez vous où le Saint Pere
passe pour une <i>Babylonienne</i> de mauvaise
vie?” Before I could make any answer
I chanced to turn my eyes upon a person
whom I had not before observed, who sat
very gravely upon a chair in a corner of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
the room, with a large periwig in full
dress upon his head.</p>

<p>The Marquis, seeing my surprise at the
sight of this unknown person, after a very
hearty fit of laughter, begged pardon for
not having introduced me sooner to that
gentleman (who was no other than a large
monkey), and then told me, he had the
honour of being attended by a physician,
who had the reputation of possessing the
greatest skill, and who <i>certainly</i> wore the
largest periwigs of any doctor in the province.
That one morning, while he was
writing a prescription at his bed-side, this
same monkey had catched hold of his periwig
by one of the knots, and instantly
made the best of his way out at the window
to the roof of a neighbouring house, from
which post he could not be dislodged, till
the Doctor, having lost patience, had sent
home for another wig, and never after
could be prevailed on to accept of this,
which had been so much disgraced. That,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
<i>enfin</i>, his valet, to whom the monkey belonged,
had, ever since that adventure,
obliged the culprit, by way of punishment,
to sit quietly for an hour every morning,
with the periwig on his head.—Et pendant
ces moments de tranquilité je suis
honoré de la société du vénérable personage.
Then addressing himself to the monkey,
“Adieu, mon ami, pour aujourdhui—au
plaisir de vous revoir;” and the servant
immediately carried Monsieur le Medecin
out of the room.</p>

<p>Afraid that the Marquis might be the
worse for talking so much, I attempted to
withdraw, promising to return in the
evening; but this I could not get him to
comply with. He assured me, that nothing
did him so much harm as holding his
tongue; and that the most excessive headach
he had ever had in his life, was owing
to his having been two hours without
speaking, when he made his addresses to
Madam de ——; who could never forgive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
those who broke in upon the thread of her
discourse, and whom he <i>lost</i> after all, by
uttering a few sentences before she could
recover her breath after a fit of sneezing.
In most people’s discourse, added he, a
sneeze passes for a full stop. “Mais dans
le Caquet eternel de cette femme ce
n’est qu’un virgule.”</p>

<p>I then enquired after my friends Dubois
and Fanchon.—He told me, that his mother
had settled them at her house in the country,
where she herself chose, of late, to pass at
least one half of the year; that Dubois was
of great service to her, in the quality of
steward, and she had taken a strong affection
for Fanchon, and that both husband
and wife were loved and esteemed by the
whole neighbourhood. “I once,” continued
the Marquis, “proposed to Fanchon,
en badinant, to make a trip to Paris,
for she must be tired of so much solitude.”
“Have I not my husband?” said she,
“Your husband is not company,” rejoined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
I, “your husband, you know, is yourself.
What do you think was her answer?”
“Elle m’a répondu,” continued the Marquis,
“Ah, Monsieur le Marquis, plus on
sé loigne de soi-même, plus on s’écarte
du bonheur.”</p>

<p>In the progress of our conversation, I enquired
about the lady to whom he was to
have been married, when the match was so
abruptly broken off by her father. He
told me, the old gentleman’s behaviour was
explained a short time after our departure
from Paris, by his daughter’s marriage to a
man of great fortune; but whose taste,
character, and turn of mind were essentially
different from those of the young lady.
“I suppose then,” said I, “she appeared
indifferent about him from the beginning.”
“Pardonnez moi,” replied the
Marquis, “au commencement elle joua la
belle passion pour son mari, jusqu’à scandaliser
le monde, peu à peu elle devint
plus raisonable, et sur cet article les deux<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
epoux jouèrent bientôt à fortune égale,
à présent ils s’amusent à se chicaner de
petites contradictions qui jettent plus
d’amertume dans le commerce que de torts
décidés.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever renew your acquaintance?”</p>

<p>“Je ne pouvois faire autrement, elle a
marqué quelques petits regrets de m’avoir
traité si cruellement.”</p>

<p>“And how did you like her,” said I,
“on farther acquaintance?”</p>

<p>“Je lui ai trouvé,” answered he, “tout
ce qu’on pent souhaiter dans <i>la femme
d’un autre</i>.”</p>

<p>The Marquis, feeling himself a little
cold, and rising from the sopha to ring for
some wood, had a view of the street. “O
ho,” cried he, looking earnestly through
the window, “regardez, regardez cet
homme”—“Quel homme?” said I. “Cet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
homme à gros ventre,” said he; and
while he spoke, his teeth began to chatter.
“Ah, Diable, voilà mon chien d’accés—cet
homme qui marche comme un Di—Di—Dindon,
c’est l’aumonier du regiment.”
I begged he would allow himself
to be put to bed, for by this time he
was all over shivering with the violence of
the ague.</p>

<p>“Non, non, ce n’est rien,” said he, “il
faut absolument que je vous conte cette
histoire. Cet homme qui s’engraisse en
nettoy—nett—et—et—en nettoyant l’ame
de mes soldats, faisoit les yeux doux à la
femme d’un Ca—Ca—Caporal—Diantre
je n’en peux plus. Adieu, mon ami, c’est
la plus plaisante hist—sis—peste! demandez
mes gens.”</p>

<p>He was put to bed directly. I found the
court below full of soldiers, who had come
to enquire after their Colonel. Before I had
reached the street, the Marquis’s Valet-de-Chambre
overtook me, le ris sur la bouche,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
et les larmes aux yeux, with a message
from his master.</p>

<p>The soldiers crowded about us, with
anxiety on all their countenances. I assured
them, there was no danger; that their
Colonel would be well within a very few
days. This was heard with every mark of
joy, and they dispersed, to communicate
the good news to their comrades.</p>

<p>“Ah, Monsieur,” said the Valet, addressing
himself to me, “il est tant aimé de ces
braves Garçons! et il merite si bien de
l’être!”</p>

<p>Next day he looked better, and was in
his usual spirits; the day following, he
was still better; and having taken a proper
quantity of the bark during the interval,
he had no return of the fever. As he has
promised to continue the use of the bark,
in sufficient doses, for some time, and as
relapses are not frequent at this season of
the year, I am persuaded the affair is over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
and that he will gradually gain strength till
he is perfectly recovered.</p>

<p>He received me with less gaiety than
usual, the day on which I took my leave,
and used many obliging expressions, which,
however you may smile, I am entirely disposed
to believe were sincere; for</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Just as I was returning, we heard the
music of the troops marching off the parade.—“Apropos,”
cried he, “How do
your affairs go on with your Colonies?”
I said, I hoped every thing would be arranged
and settled very soon.</p>

<p>“Ne croyez vous pas,” said he, “que
ces Messieurs,” pointing to the troops
which then passed below the window,
“pourroient entrer pour quelque chose dans
l’arrangement?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span></p>

<p>I said, I did not imagine the Americans
were such fools as to break all connection
with their friends, and then risk falling into
the power of their enemies.</p>

<p>“Il me semble,” answered he, “que ces
Messieurs font assez peu de cas de votre
amitié, et aussi, quand vous aurez prouvé
qu’ils ont tort, il ne s’en suivra pas que
vous ayiez toujours eu raison.” “Allons,”
continued he, seeing that I looked a little
grave, “point d’humeur;” then seizing
my hand, “permettez moi, je vous prie,
d’aimer les Anglois sans haïr les Américains.”</p>

<p>I soon after parted with this amiable
Frenchman, whose gaiety, wit, and agreeable
manners, if I may judge from my own
experience, represent the character and disposition
of great numbers of his countrymen.</p>

<p>After a very agreeable journey by Gray,
Langres, and Troyes, we arrived at this
capital a few days ago.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="LETTER_LXXXII">LETTER LXXXII.</h2>

<p class="right">Paris.</p>

<p>Although it is a considerable time
since my arrival, yet, as you made
so long a stay at Paris while we were in
Germany, I could not think of resuming
my observations on the manners of this
gay metropolis. It has been said, that
those times are the most interesting to read
of, which were the most disagreeable to
live in. So I find the places in which it is
most agreeable to reside, are precisely those
from which we have the least inclination to
write. There are so many resources at
Paris, that it always requires a great effort
to write letters, of any considerable length,
from such a place. This is peculiarly my
case at present, as I have the happiness of
passing great part of my time with Mr.
A—— S——t, whom I found at this
hotel on my arrival. The integrity, candour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
and ability, of that gentleman’s conduct,
during a long residence, have procured
him a great number of friends in this
capital, and have established a character
which calumny attempted in vain to overthrow.
Now that I have resolution to take
up my pen, I shall endeavour to clear the
debt for which you dun me so unmercifully.
I own, I am surprised, that you should
require my opinion on the uses of foreign
travel, after perusing, as you must have
done, the Dialogues, lately published by
an eminent divine, equally distinguished
for his learning and taste. But as I know
what makes you peculiarly solicitous on
that subject at present, I shall give you
my sentiments, such as they are, without
farther hesitation.</p>

<p>I cannot help thinking, that a young
man of fortune may spend a few years to
advantage, in travelling through some of
the principal countries of Europe, provided
the tour be well-timed, and well-conducted;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
and, without these, what part of
education can be of use?</p>

<p>In a former letter, I gave my reasons for
preferring the plan of education at the
public schools of England, to any other
now in use at home or abroad. After the
young person has acquired the fundamental
parts of learning, which are taught at
schools, he will naturally be removed to
some university. One of the most elegant
and most ingenious writers of the present
age has, in his Inquiry into the Causes of
the Wealth of Nations, pointed out many
deficiencies in those seminaries. What that
gentleman has said on this subject, may
possibly have some effect in bringing about
an improvement. But, with all their deficiencies,
it must be acknowledged, that
no universities have produced a greater
number of men distinguished for polite literature,
and eminent for science, than
those of England. If a young man has,
previously, acquired the habit of application,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
and a taste for learning, he will certainly
find the means of improvement
there; and, without these, I know not
where he will make any progress in literature.
But whatever plan is adopted,
whether the young man studies at the university,
or at home with private teachers,
while he is studying with diligence and
alacrity, it would be doing him a most
essential injury, to interrupt him by a premature
expedition to the Continent, from
an idea of his acquiring the graces, elegance
of manner, or any of the accomplishments
which travelling is supposed to give.
Literature is preferable to all other accomplishments,
and the men of rank who
possess it, have a superiority over those who
do not, let their graces be what they may,
which the latter feel and envy, while they
affect to despise.</p>

<p>According to this plan, a youth, properly
educated, will seldom begin his
foreign tour before the age of twenty; if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
it is a year or two later, there will be no
harm.</p>

<p>This is the age, it may be said, when
young men of fortune endeavour to get
into Parliament: it is so; but if they should
remain out of Parliament till they are a
few years older, the affairs of the nation
might possibly go on as well.</p>

<p>It may also be said, if the tour is deferred
till the age of twenty, the youth will
not, after that period of life, attain the
modern languages in perfection. Nor
will he acquire that easy manner, and fine
address, which are only caught by an early
acquaintance with courts, and the assemblies
of the gay and elegant. This is true to a
certain degree; but the answer is, that by
remaining at home, and applying to the
pursuits of literature, he will make more
valuable attainments.</p>

<p>I am at a loss what to say about those
same graces; it is certainly desirable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
possess them, but they must come, as it
were, spontaneously, or they will not come
at all. They sometimes appear as volunteers,
but cannot be pressed into any service;
and those who shew the greatest
anxiety about them, are the least likely to
attain them. I should be cautious, therefore,
of advising a young man to study
them either at home or abroad with much
solicitude. Students of the graces are, generally,
the most abominably affected fellows
in the world. I have seen <i>one</i> of them
make a whole company squeamish.</p>

<p>Though the pert familiarity of French
children would not become an English boy,
yet it merits the earliest and the utmost attention
to prevent or conquer that aukward
timidity which so often oppresses
the latter when he comes into company.
The timidity I speak of, is entirely different
from modesty. I have seen the most impudent
boys I ever knew, almost convulsed
with constraint in the presence of strangers,
or when they were required to pronounce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
a single sentence of civility. But it was
only on such occasions they were bashful.
Among their companions or inferiors, they
were saucy, rude, and boisterous.</p>

<p>If boys of this description <i>only</i> were
liable to bashfulness, it would be a pity to
remove it. But although this quality is
distinct from modesty, it is not incompatible
with it. Boys of the most modest and most
amiable disposition are often overwhelmed
with it; from them it ought to be removed,
if it can be done, without endangering that
modesty which is so great an ornament to
youth, and indeed to every period of life.
This, surely, may be done in England, as
well as in any other country; but it is too
much neglected: many consider it as a
matter of no importance, or that it will
wear off by time. We see it, however,
often annihilate, and always impair the
effect of the greatest and most useful
talents. After the care of forming the
heart by the principles of benevolence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
integrity, perhaps one of the most important
parts of education is, to habituate
a boy to behave with modesty, but without
restraint, and to retain the full possession of
all his faculties in any company.</p>

<p>To attain, betimes, that ease and elegance
of manner, which travelling is supposed
to bestow, and that the young gentleman
may become perfectly master of the
modern languages, some have thought
of mixing the two plans; and, instead of
allowing him to prosecute his studies at
home, sending him abroad, immediately
on his coming from school, on the supposition
that, with the assistance of a tutor
and foreign professors, he will proceed in
the study of philosophy, and other branches
of literature, during the three or four
years which are employed in the usual
tour. It will not be denied, that a young
man who has made good use of his time at
school and at the university, who has acquired
such a taste for science as to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
its pursuits as a pleasure, and not a task,
may, even during his travels, mix the
study of men with that of books, and continue
to make progress in the latter, when
the greater part of his time is dedicated to
the former. But that such a taste will, for
<i>the first time</i>, spring up in the breast of a
boy of sixteen or seventeen, amidst the dissipation
of theatres, reviews, processions,
balls, and assemblies, is of all things the
least probable.</p>

<p>Others, who think lightly of the importance
of what is usually called science to a
young man of rank and fortune, still contend,
that a knowledge of history, which
they admit may be of some use <i>even to
men of fortune</i>, can certainly be acquired
during the years of travelling. But what
sort of a knowledge will it be which a boy,
in such a situation, will acquire? Not that
which Lord Bolingbroke calls philosophy,
teaching by examples, a proper conduct in
the various situations of public and private<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
life, but merely a succession of reigns, of
battles, and sieges, stored up in the memory
without reflection or application. I
remember a young gentleman, whom a
strong and retentive memory of such events
often set a prating very mal-à-propos; one
of his companions expressed much surprise
at his knowledge, and wondered how he had
laid up such a store. “Why, truly,”
replied he, with frankness, “it is all owing
to my bungling blockhead of a valet,
who takes up such an unconscionable
time in dressing my hair, that I am glad
to read to keep me from fretting; and
as there are no newspapers, or magazines,
to be had in this country, I have
been driven to history, which answers
nearly as well.”</p>

<p>But it sometimes happens, that young
men who are far behind their contemporaries
in every kind of literature, are wonderfully
advanced in the knowledge of the
town, so as to vie with the oldest professors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
in London, and endanger their own health
by the ardour of their application. The
sooner such premature youths are separated
from the connections they have formed in
the metropolis, the better; and as it will
not be easy to persuade them to live in
any other part of Great Britain, it will be
necessary to send them abroad. But, instead
of being carried to courts and capitals,
the best plan for them will be, to fix
them in some provincial town of France or
Switzerland, where they may have a chance
of improving, not so much by new attainments,
as by unlearning or forgetting
what they have already acquired.</p>

<p>After a young man has employed his
time to advantage at a public school, and
has continued his application to various
branches of science till the age of twenty,
you ask, what are the advantages he is
likely to reap from a tour abroad?</p>

<p>He will see mankind more at large, and
in numberless situations and points of view,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
in which they cannot appear in Great Britain,
or any one country. By comparing
the various customs and usages, and hearing
the received opinions of different countries,
his mind will be enlarged. He will
be enabled to correct the theoretical notions
he may have formed of human nature, by
the practical knowledge of men. By contemplating
their various religions, laws,
and government, <i>in action</i>, as it were, and
observing the effects they produce on the
minds and characters of the people, he will
be able to form a juster estimate of their
value than otherwise he could have done.
He will see the natives of other countries,
not as he sees them in England, mere idle
spectators, but busily employed in their
various characters, as actors on their own
proper stage. He will gradually improve
in the knowledge of <i>character</i>, not of Englishmen
only, but of men in general; he
will cease to be deceived either by the varnish
with which men are apt to heighten
their own actions, or the dark colours in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
which they, too often, paint those of
others. He will learn to distinguish the
real from the ostensible motive of men’s
words and behaviour. Finally, by being
received with hospitality, conversing familiarly,
and living in the reciprocal exchange
of good offices with those whom he considered
as enemies, or in some unfavourable
point of view, the sphere of his benevolence
and good-will to his brethren of mankind
will gradually enlarge. His friendships
extending beyond the limits, of his
own country, will embrace characters congenial
with his own in other nations. Seas,
mountains, rivers, are <i>geographical</i> boundaries,
but never limited the good-will or
esteem of one liberal mind. As for his
manner, though it will probably not be so
janty as if he had been bred in France
from his earliest youth, yet that also will
in some degree be improved.</p>

<p>However persuaded he may be of the
advantages enjoyed by the people of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
he will see the harshness and impropriety
of insulting the natives of other
countries with an ostentatious enumeration
of those advantages; he will perceive how
odious those travellers make themselves,
who laugh at the religion, ridicule the
customs, and insult the police of the countries
through which they pass, and who
never fail to insinuate to the inhabitants
that they are all slaves and bigots. Such
bold Britons we have sometimes met with,
<i>fighting</i> their way through Europe, who,
by their continual broils and disputes,
would lead one to imagine that the angel
of the Lord had pronounced on each of
them the same denunciation which he did
on Ishmael the son of Abraham, by his
handmaid Hagar. “And he will be a
wild man, and his hand will be against
every man, and every man’s hand
against him<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.” If the same unsocial
disposition should creep into our politics, it
might arm all the powers in Europe against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
Great Britain, before she gets clear of her
unhappy contest with America. A young
man, whose mind has been formed as it
ought, before he goes abroad, when he sees
many individuals preserve personal dignity
in spite of arbitrary government, an independent
mind amidst poverty, liberal and
philosophic sentiments amidst bigotry and
superstition; must naturally have the highest
esteem for such characters, and allow
them more merit than those even of his
own country, who think and act in the
same manner in less unfavourable circumstances.</p>

<p>Besides these advantages, a young man
of fortune, by spending a few years abroad,
will gratify a natural and laudable curiosity,
and pass a certain portion of his life in an
agreeable manner. He will form an acquaintance
with that boasted nation, whose
superior taste and politeness are universally
acknowledged; whose fashions and language
are adopted by all Europe; and who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
in science, power, and commerce, are the
rivals of Great Britain. He will have opportunities
of observing the political constitution
of the German empire; that complex
body, formed by a confederacy of princes,
ecclesiastics, and free cities, comprehending
countries of vast extent, inhabited by a
hardy race of men, distinguished for solid
sense and integrity, who, without having
equalled their sprightlier neighbours in
works of taste or imagination, have shewn
what prodigious efforts of application the
human mind is capable of in the severest
and least amusing studies, and whose armies
exhibit at present the most perfect
models of military discipline. In contemplating
these, he will naturally consider,
whether those armies tend most to the
aggrandizement of the Monarch, or to defend
or preserve any thing to the people
who maintain them, and the soldiers who
compose them, equivalent to the vast expence
of money, and the still greater quantity of
misery which they occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span></p>

<p>Viewing the remains of Roman taste and
magnificence, he will feel a thousand emotions
of the most interesting nature, while
those whose minds are not, like his, stored
with classical knowledge, gaze with tasteless
wonder, or phlegmatic indifference;
and, exclusive of those monuments of antiquity,
he will naturally desire to be acquainted
with the present inhabitants of a
country, which at different periods has
produced men who, by one means or another,
have distinguished themselves so eminently
from their contemporaries of other
nations. At one period, having subdued the
world by the wisdom and firmness of their
councils, and the disciplined vigour of their
armies, Rome became at once the seat of
empire, learning, and the arts.</p>

<p>After the Northern barbarians had destroyed
the overgrown fabric of Roman
power, a new empire, of a more singular
nature, gradually arose from its ruins, artfully
extending its influence over the minds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
of men, till the Princes of Europe were at
length as much controlled by the bulls of
the Vatican, as their ancestors had been by
the decrees of the Senate.</p>

<p>Commerce also, which rapine and
slaughter had frightened from Europe, returned,
and joined with Superstition in
drawing the riches of all the neighbouring
nations to Italy. And, at a subsequent
period, Learning, bursting through the
clouds of ignorance which overshadowed
mankind, again shone forth in the same
country, bringing in her train, Poetry,
Painting, Sculpture, and Music, all of
which have been cultivated with the greatest
success; and the three last brought, by
the inhabitants of this country, to a degree
of excellence unequalled by the natives
of any other country of the world.
When to these considerations we add, that
there is reason to believe that this country
had arrived at a great degree of perfection
in the arts before the beginning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
Roman republic, we are almost tempted
to believe, that local and physical causes
have a considerable influence in rendering
the mind more acute in this country of
Italy, than any where else; and that if
the infinite political disadvantages under
which it labours were removed, and the
whole of this peninsula united in one
State, it would again resume its superiority
over other nations.</p>

<p>Lastly, by visiting other countries, a
subject of Great Britain will acquire a
greater esteem than ever for the constitution
of his own. Freed from vulgar
prejudices, he will perceive, that the blessings
and advantages which his countrymen
enjoy, do not flow from their superiority
in wisdom, courage, or virtue,
over the other nations of the world, but,
in some degree, from the peculiarity of
their situation in an island; and, above all,
from those just and equitable laws which
secure property, that mild free government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
which abhors tyranny, protects the
meanest subject, and leaves the mind of
man to its own exertions, unrestrained by
those arbitrary, capricious, and impolitic
shackles, which confine and weaken its noblest
endeavours in almost every other
country of the world. This animates industry,
creates fertility, and scatters plenty
over the boisterous island of Great Britain,
with a profusion unknown in the neighbouring
nations, who behold with astonishment
such numbers of British subjects,
of both sexes, and of all ages, roaming
discontented through the lands of despotism,
in search of that happiness, which,
if satiety and the wanton restlessness of
wealth would permit, they have a much
better prospect of enjoying in their own
country.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
